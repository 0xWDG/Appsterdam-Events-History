Your resume ends up in the pile, you do this to avoid it

app CV tips &amp; Tricks from Jacqueline

Getting an interview can be difficult, the competition is high. If you are an app developer and thinking about a new job, don't forget to check your resume if it is up to date, does it represent you on paper? It's just a paper, you could think, of course it is, it probably represents only 40% of who you really are as a person, as a developer. But, the paper could be your way to open a door at the company you like, so better be right the first time they see your "business card."
