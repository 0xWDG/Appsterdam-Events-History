Join Pinch, Jacqueline (House of Appril) and Appsterdam, for a delightful evening at Pinch Headquarters in Amsterdam.

This event will feature panel discussions with women in the industry, as well as opportunities for networking, sharing experiences, enjoying refreshing drinks, and, indulging in a delicious dinner. As the title indicates this event is for women and people who identify as such.

During the event, we will have two panel discussions where the host will lead a conversation on what it's like being a woman in the tech industry. We will also discuss how to navigate the challenges of working in a male-dominated field, along with experts in the area. Each panel discussion will last for approximately 40 minutes, followed by a Q&amp;A session.

Schedule for the night:

* 5:00 PM: Doors open/ Drinks &amp; mingling

* 5:30 PM: I Panel discussion starts

* 6:30 PM: Dinner

We hope to see you there.
