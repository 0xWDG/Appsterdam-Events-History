### Amsterdam Light Festival (Edition 11)

For the next 53 days, 20 light artworks turn the historic center of Amsterdam into an outdoor exhibition space. From interactive lampposts, to a giant ball of yarn and from luminous fireflies to an installation that makes it seem like the water is burning. The works of Edition 11 trigger your imagination. Be sure to come and see them.
