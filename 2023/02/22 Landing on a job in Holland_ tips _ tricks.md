**About me / my network**

Founder of The House of Appril &amp; the Apprill Festival, a connector at heart. First as the initiator for the grassroots event Appril festival, where I connect people, knowledge and inspiration.

From the festival and an ever growing network of talented developers and clients eventually grew The House of Appril. With The House of Appril I'm supporting organisations expanding their

team by matching the right freelancer, employee, or independent contractor. Firmly rooted in the Dutch app community, my network contains what you need to speed up the development of

your app. Next to this I record podcasts with app developers and I'm an active member of Appsterdam. I thrive on meeting and connecting people who combine great ideas with the skills

and drive to realise them.
