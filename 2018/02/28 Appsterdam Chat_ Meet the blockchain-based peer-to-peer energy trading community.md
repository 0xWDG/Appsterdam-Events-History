Have you ever wanted to buy a beer and pay in kilowatts? This is a reality now thanks to our "Prosumer" neighbors from the De Ceuvel Cafe. During this special Appsterdam Business Chat we'll be speaking to Stephen Donnelly who works for Spectral - a tech development and system integration company in the smart energy domain, based in Amsterdam. As well as covering the role of software and data in the energy transition, this session will cover aspects of Spectral's current software offering which includes: energy management systems, energy portfolio management tools and platforms for smart communities and blockchain-based peer-to-peer energy trading. There will be a particular focus on the latter which has been implemented at De Ceuvel as a blockchain token called the Jouliette; in the longer term, Spectral's goal is to create a platform for prosumers, microgrids, industry stakeholders (including DSOs and TSOs) and larger-scale renewable generation to exchange energy, flexibility and other data-driven services using a blockchain-based approach.

Stephen is the CIO at Spectral. Stephen has more than 20 years' experience of technology deployments across multiple roles from software development to process consultancy and project management. He holds a Masters in Engineering and Computer Science from Oxford University.

One thing I have learned talking to people around the world is that lack of VC funding is never the problem. The problem is that people think about business the wrong way.

Appsterdam Business Chat is your chance to get advice about whatever it is you're trying to do from someone who knows how to do things.
