Join us in the cozy cafe where Appsterdam was born.

This is the place for you to meet your fellow Appsterdammers in a relaxed setting. Get to know members of the community, meet a potential business partner, bring your app¬†to share with others, exchange ideas with like-minded people... No talks are ever scheduled and everyone is always welcome to join.

Be sure to ask the waitress/waiter about their seasonal beers and grab a snack to share with your friends. All Appsterdammers get *10% off*¬†*the entire bill*, so order whatever you want to eat/drink.¬†Then sit back and enjoy the company of your peers.

The time is always **Wednesday at 19:00**. The place is always **[Caf√© Bax](http://www.cafebax.nl/)**.

*Please note: It's a very casual event so people often don't RSVP or show up exactly at 19:00. So don't fear, you can *always* find Appsterdammers at this event! Not sure you're in the right place? Just ask the waiters!*
