Over the years, Appsterdam has organized many tech-events to tackle important issues for many industries like energy, mobility, tourism and more - but when it comes to Hackathons, most of have "been there, and done that". In 2018, do these "purposeful hackathons" have any impact on the industry we try to change? For this special Business Chat we'll speak with Anne Bruinsma and learn about the important work she is doing at FarmHack.NL - organizer of tech events to tackle urgent issues from over-fishing to sustainable farming. This will be very informal but interactive session where we will explore the past, present and future of hackathons, and how they can still influence industries. We invite coders, designers, business developers to join us on Wednesday to help re-imagine the hackathon. Bring your own experiences and ideas for the ideal Future Hackathon (and I'll bring the donuts!)

One thing I have learned talking to people around the world is that lack of VC funding is never the problem. The problem is that people think about business the wrong way.

Appsterdam Business Chat is your chance to get advice about whatever it is you're trying to do from someone who knows how to do things.

Appsterdam provides coffee and tea, and snacks, typically donuts. If you have special requests or suggestions, let us know in the comments.

If you would like to make a day of it, you are welcome to bring your laptop and sit in our free workspace provided by A Lab, then join us in the evening for dinner and drinks at Cafe Bax.

Everyone is welcome regardless of technical knowledge.
