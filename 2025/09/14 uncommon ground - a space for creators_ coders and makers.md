We’re hosting a pop-up creators’ and makers’ space: an open, low-barrier environment where people of all disciplines can come together to create. Participants bring their own tools, whether that’s a laptop, a sketchbook, a typewriter, or a crochet kit and spend time making, coding, writing, drawing, or building.
The concept is simple: no workshops, no formal program, just an open space where everyone is welcome to focus on their own project or get inspired by others. It’s about creating side by side, with minimal structure and maximum accessibility.
People can learn and inspire each other.
The event is intended to cross-pollination between different disciplines, spark fresh ideas, and inspire participants to explore skills outside their comfort zone.
Everyone is welcome, regardless of background or experience.
