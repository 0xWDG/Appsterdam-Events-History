**Session Overview**

This presentation is a shortcut to building cross-platform Flutter apps: iOS, Android, web, and even desktop! You've probably built UI and made API calls before, so how is this best done in Flutter?

We'll discuss the motivations for using Flutter over its competitors. We'll show what the developer needs to know about how it works. Then there will be a step by step coding walk-through, which shows how to avoid common mistakes.

By the end, you'll have a full understanding of how one codebase can be written for an excellent user experience on all platforms, along with best practices for state management and networking. You'll also have access to the codebase of the performant sample app we'll create. You'll have what's needed to build Flutter projects elegantly.
