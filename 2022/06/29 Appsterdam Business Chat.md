**ATTENTION** Until further notice Appsterdam Business Chat is online and on-demand.

What this means is, I will schedule an hour to chat with you about what you're trying to do, and what advice I can offer.

I've spoken to thousands of people all over the world, and I've noticed some patterns.

Most people think that a lack of investment money is what is holding them back, but the real problem is that people think about business the wrong way.

Appsterdam Business Chat is your chance to get advice about whatever it is you're trying to do from someone who knows how to do things.

Everyone is welcome regardless of technical knowledge.
