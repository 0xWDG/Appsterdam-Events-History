Lecture Topic

I have an idea! - The gap between ideas and IT

Lecture Abstract

The gap between ideas and IT is often underestimated, but well known to those involved in software development. On one side there are the people with an, often brilliant, idea. They just need a developer to build it for them. Cheap, please. On the other side there are the developers, who'd often wish that the expectations of the idea people were a bit more realistic.

This talk targets both idea people and developers, to bring them closer together and manage their expectations. There's a lot they can learn from each other!

A guru session will be planned as well, targeting people with an idea, to get their ideas closer to reality and realisation in a hands-on workshop. Preliminary date is June 28, more info will follow.Â 

Lecturer's Brief Bio

Marion de Groot is an independent requirements analyst and functional designer at Pick my Brain. She translates the ideas, requirements and expectations to clear and realistic specifications for the developer and makes sure the customer gets what he needs (which is not necessarily the same as what he wants or says he needs).Â

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
