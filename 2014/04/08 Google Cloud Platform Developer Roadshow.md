After the cool [Cloud Platform Live announcements](https://cloud.google.com/events/google-cloud-platform-live/) this week, Google is also bringing lot of developer goodness to Amsterdam. Speakers have just been announced for the Cloud Platform Roadshow here on April 8: Andrew Jessup, Daniel Galpin and Robert-Jan Huijsman

It's free to come, so I hope you will join for some inspiration and hands-on look at the new tools, rapidly building your mobile backend, and more.

Please be sure to also register at the [Google Cloud Platform Roadshow page](http://lp.google-mkto.com/cloud-platform-roadshow.html?utm_source=appsterdam&utm_medium=social), so they know to print you a nametag and how much food to buy!

**Sessions:**

**From Zero to Fully-Functioning App

** In just one hour we'll step through everything you need to build an Android application that uses Cloud services to provide a fun experience. You'll see many of the elements of the platform in action, including Compute Engine, App Engine, Cloud Storage, VM Engines, Cloud Endpoints and much more. You'll come away seeing how easy it is to build an application that runs at Google scale.

**Blurring the Iaas/PaaS Divide

** We're introducing a brand new way of thinking about development for the cloud -- one which takes the best of both IaaS and PaaS but removes the false choice. What if you wanted to build an app that had the great management of one built on a PaaS platform, but needed capabilities that weren't supported. You could build it using IaaS, but you'd need to do a lot of management. In this session we'll show you how this wall can be breached, and how you can start building applications for the next version of the cloud.

**New Frontiers in Cloud Development

** We have a wonderful new way for developers to build cloud applications. We can't talk much about it yet, but we know you're going to love it. In this session you'll get hands-on with how to use it!
