Appril invites 15 Appsterdam Developers for an experimental concert: *Apps and Jazz* on Wednesday, April 23 from 14:00 to 16:00.Â 

[Tin Men and the Telephone](http://tinmenandthetelephone.com/) is a young jazz trio. They have released their latest album as an [iOSÂ app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appjenou-!/id696870551). With this app you can both listen to their music and take part in the performance!

You can chat with the pianist during the show, rate a solo, and before you know your ringtone is part of a composition.Â 

In [Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ](http://www.muziekgebouw.nl/), the musicians willÂ give you a unique look behind the scenes: all about why and how they developed the app. You will see and hear many examples as well as a mini concert!

**RSVP now! Note, as we always ask with special events: there might be wait list. As soon as you know you will not make it to the event: free up your space, RSVP NO and let a colleague in!**
