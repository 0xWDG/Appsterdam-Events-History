Our guest lecturer this week is: **Rik Van Bruggen**

Lecture Topic: **Graphs for Everyone!**

**Abstract**: Graphs offer application developers a fantastic, flexible and fast way to store and access their data. In this talk, we will introduce and illustrate the main concepts, and focus on what this can bring to app developers.

This week, we are honored to have **Rik Van Bruggen** as our guest lecturer.**Â **Rik is the regional territory manager for Neo Technology for the BeNeLux, UK, and Nordics. He has been working for startup companies for most of his career, and while he has a fond technical interest, really is passionate about business - and about Belgian Beer.

**Please note that starting this week, the lectures will be held at the Appsterdam HQ at A Lab.**

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
