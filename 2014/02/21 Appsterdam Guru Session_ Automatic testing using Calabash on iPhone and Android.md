Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

**Description **

Automated testing is a challenge for Mobile Developers. During this guru session, we will dive into automated testing for Android or iOS using Calabash.

Calabash could be compared to Selenium for smartphones. It is a functional testing tool/language based on business language also used in your user stories. Calabash enables you to programmatically tell your device (phone, tablet or emulator) what to do. This will enable you, as a programmer, to check the functional behavior of your cross platform apps (Android or iOS) like a human would. For smaller projects you might choose to do this yourself, but when applications become larger and thus will contain more and more functionality and features, you will want to automate this in some way.

Using native libraries, Calabash is able to simulate end­user (human­like) actions such as touch gestures (tap, swipe, and rotate), assertions such as determining there is a "login" button or that a web view contains an "&lt;h1&gt;" tag, or take screenshots of the current screen of the device.

During the guru session at M2Mobi, we will present how Calabash can be used for automated testing in your project and we will create an automated testing script for a sample application to try it out directly.
