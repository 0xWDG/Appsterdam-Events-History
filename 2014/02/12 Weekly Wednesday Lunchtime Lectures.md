Our guest lecturer this week is: **Jonathan Carter**Â from Glimworm IT BV.

This week's topic: **iBeacon**

**Jonathan**Â will shed some lights on iBeacon, an indoor positioning system that Apple calls "a new class of low-powered, low-cost transmitters that can notify nearby iOS7 devices of their presence". If time permits, you will see iBeacon being used in action.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
