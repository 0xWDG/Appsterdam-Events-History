Join us on February 15 as we celebrate our 4th Annual Kohlfahrt in Bremen, Germany!

**A kohl-what?!?**

The season of long nights in northern Europe can become dreary and depressing, and a winter feast is just the thing, but trudging through snow to the feasting hall isn't any kind of funâ€”unless you make it fun. Thus was born the northern German tradition of the ***Kohlfahrt***, or "cabbage quest." Join us as we brave Bremen's frozen forests, dragging wagons of booze. Along the way we will make frequent stops to lighten our load with drinking games, and lighten our mood with party games.

Upon arriving at the feasting hall, we will slake our thirst with soup and beer, and fill our bellies with sausage, potatoes, and lest we forgetâ€”cabbage. The people who eat the most and dominate the games are crowned Cabbage King and Queen, and granted the solemn duty of organizing next year's kohlfahrt. Then we dance the night away like people who don't know how to dance, but aren't about to let that stop them from having a good time.

Did we mention the booze wagon? Check out some photos of last year's kohlfahrt from [@mariusLAN](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mariuslan/sets/72157632843443665/detail/) and [@_jona_as](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jojppa/sets/72157632840763673/)!
