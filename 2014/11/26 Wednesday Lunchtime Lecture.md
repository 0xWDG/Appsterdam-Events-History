Paul Manwaring will give a comprehensive presentation on iBeacons, a brief lecture considered as "iBeacons 101." This lecture, targeted at a general audience, will answer the questions:

What are iBeacons? How do they work? How do we use them now? And what are possible applications in the future?

Paul Manwaring is co-founder and Creative Director at [Glimworm IT BV](http://glimworm.com). His company has started Glimworm Beacons, the first mass producer of iBeacon sensors in the Netherlands. The Glimworm Beacons are secure with a 6 digit PIN code, has easy access to a replaceable battery, and has an elegant, high gloss design that can be customized.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
