Appsterdam is proud to announce a Guru Session that tackles the famous question “I have an idea for an app, what next?”. This is the second of three workshops that match ideas to actual app makers.

Our second session entitled **“I’ve developed my idea, now what?”** we will be tackling the importance of “communication” in two parts. Part One is prototyping where participants are asked to develop simple interactive mockups to share with peers for feedback. Part 2 are mini workshops in funding. We will be talking to a few local heros in crowd funding and accelerator programs how to get from idea to market. 

Homework: Prepare references of similar apps or apps that inspire you. Sketch out 5 screens using Screen Template.

**“Quick and Dirty Prototyping”**

Tom van Arman of Tapp will teach you the fundamentals of rapid prototyping for people without knowledge of design or programming. Using free-online tools you will sketch and make 5 screens interactive so you can explain your killer app idea to others. 

**“Crash Course Crowdfunding" **

In this Crash Course Crowdfunding we wil focus on the why and how of accelerating your projects through the crowd, taking you through the 9 basic principles derived from preparation, story and connection.

There are multiple goals that can be achieved through the crowd: not only funding but also market validation, a big launch and building and activating a community to name a few. Moving crowds has three main components: excellent preparation, a damn good story and passionately seeking connection. Your strategy should be developed around them. 

Karim Maarek, founder of Teach to Fish, is a crowdfunding and crowdcampaigning specialist. He has developed numerous training and acceleration programs and is especially interested in scaling sustainable and creative ventures, via the crowd. Karim firmly believes that crowdfunding and crowd principles should be applied to any enterprise whatsoever. 

In the 18 months since its founding, Teach to Fish has aided clients in raising over half a million euros in funding. The intensive, step-by-step Crowd Acceleration Program is the flagship product of Teach to Fish.

**“Accelerators and Incubators”**

Cralan Deutsch of LeadBoxer will share insights gained from a ride in the Rockstart Accelerator. Leadboxer was one of 10 start-ups selected out of 500 for the 2014 Web-Mobile program.

By the end of the session you’ll have an idea of what an accelerator a) means in practice and b) can offer you. It’s a general session, no specific knowledge required, familiarity with Lean methodology would be helpful. Cralan / LeadBoxer & Opentracker have been building/ supporting SaaS for 10 years, including an app tracking on the Apple platform. 

Our company specialises in (big data) analysis of website/ app user engagement, and identification of company (lead) traffic.

Cralan likes to ride his bakfiets around amsterdam.
