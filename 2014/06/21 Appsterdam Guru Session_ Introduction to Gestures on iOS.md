Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions. Best of all, we'll provide the pizza and beer!

**Description:**

Christian Apers from Touchwonders will introduce you to Gestures on iOS.

Gestures form an essential part of your user interface. Using gestures in the right way can really enhance the user experience of your app. 

The session will cover all the basic gestures: tap, pan, swipe, pinch, rotate, double tap, etc.

We will also touch slightly more advanced topics that allow you to combine multiple gestures.

By the end of the session, you'll be able to use those gestures in your own apps. 

Already experienced with gestures? Feel free to bring your own code, there will be time to discuss the problems you are running in.

**Prerequisites:**

- basic Objective-C and iOS knowledge 

- you can work with Xcode

- you know how to put a UIView on the screen
