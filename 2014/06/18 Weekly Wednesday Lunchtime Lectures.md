**Roberto Valenti**, CTO at Sightcorp, will talk about **Human Centered Applications**.

"Touch interfaces have revolutionized the way we perceive and use smartphones and computers. The rise of this new interaction paradigm made it possible to create highly functional applications, while maintaining basic and simple interfaces. This is referred to as a "natural user interface", which allows interacting with on-screen content using both direct manipulations and gestures. Interacting with these applications is more natural than using the previous keyboard-and-mouse paradigm.

However, humans interact using many more information channels, for instance voice, body language and facial expressions. The current natural user interfaces are largely unaware of the interacting user.

In this talk, I argue that applications should detect and use information about their users, ranging from their age and gender, to their mood and attention. I will explain how important it is to read, understand, and use this untapped source of information to bootstrap the next evolution in Human-Computer Interaction: Human-Centered Applications."

**Speaker's bio:**

Dr. Roberto Valenti is the Chief Technology Officer and co-founder of Sightcorp, a joint venture with the University of Amsterdam focused on the automatic analysis of faces. After graduating with high honors in Artificial Intelligence, he completed his doctorate in machine vision at the Intelligent Systems Lab Amsterdam at the University of Amsterdam, where he currently holds a position of researcher. During his doctorate he achieved a record number of high-impact scientific publications in the field of automated human behavior analysis, face analysis and human-computer interaction. His research mainly focuses on sensing and understanding userâ€™s actions, intentions and interests by solely using off-the-shelves hardware.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
