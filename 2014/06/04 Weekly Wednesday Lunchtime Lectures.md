This week, **Joris van Eil** andÂ J**asper van Rijckevorsel** will present "**Grants & tax benefits for ICT innovation**".

**Talk Summary:**

Innovation is risky. Â Assigning resources to the development of an idea, of which the outcome is uncertain, means those resources have to be drawn away from core activities that provide a more or less guaranteed source of income.

To nurture new technologies and their inherent commercial outcomes, national and European governments have created several beneficial tax regulations and grant instruments.

In this lecture, we briefly introduce the most widely applied tax benefits and innovation grants.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
