Our sponsor KPMG is holding free Drop-in Dr. Sessions at A Lab. 

**This time it will all be about funding! **

KPMG will have experts on-site, who will sit down with you and give individual advice. Do you have one of the following (or related) questions about funding?

• Funding, when do I need it?

• How do I keep my company attractive to investors without losing its identity

• How does a funding process look like from meeting to collaborate with investors?

Also, if you have general questions regarding VAT, financial forecasts or general business questions, please feel free to drop by!

The KPMG Drop-in Dr. Sessions will be held every 1st and 3rd Wednesday from 9:30-12:00. Please RSVP so we know to expect you. 

See you then!
