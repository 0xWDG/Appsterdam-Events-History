This week, **Paul Everts** will present **"Using Geofencing to activate app users"**

**Summary**

People increasingly expect personal and relevant information. We don't want to be bothered all the time at any location. But how do you make sure your app users only receive your messages when they want them?

In this WWLL, I will explain how to achieve just that with personal, time-based and location-based notifications. Learn all the tips and tricks to set up your own successful geofencing campaign!

**Bio**

Paul is co-founder of Plot Projects.Â

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
