**The Challenge**

There‚Äôs a big change coming in the social welfare system in the Netherlands. As of 2015, the central government will delegate many of its tasks around social security and healthcare to local municipalities. When this happens, local communities themselves will create and implement their own laws for social welfare and long-term care of the sick and elderly, giving them a chance to independently decide and implement the laws, according to their own methods.¬†

This new law is called ‚Äú‚ÄòWet Maatschappelijke Ondersteuning‚Äù, or WMO. While this is a great opportunity, it also creates a lot of challenges. Local municipalities may not have the knowledge and skills required to take on this new task.

The main goal of the hackathon is to develop apps that in some way support the new implementation of WMO by municipalities.

‚ÄúWMO consultants‚Äù are professionals who will help municipalities make this transition, by organizing access to proper care, deciding on appropriate funding levels, matching care options to consumers, and delivering a fair and efficient care delivery model. Salesforce wants to help these WMO consultants, as well as the care providers and the customers to streamline and optimize this new process.

We challenge you to create apps to support WMO consultants and municipalities in this transition.

Some examples of themes and problems to be solved:

‚óè¬† Enabling face-to-face ‚Äúkitchen table‚Äù conversations between WMO Consultants and consumers eligible for assistance

‚óè¬† Dealing with limited funds for welfare and health care such as a fair method of distribution.

‚óè¬† Processes and workflows for municipalities to run smoothly

‚óè¬† Strategies for municipalities to inform citizens about this new policy.
