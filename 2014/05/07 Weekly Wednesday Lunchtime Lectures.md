More details are below.

**Ist Speaker**

**Wilbert¬†Baan**

Summary:

**Product Design:** Digital products and services drive today's companies. Startups are disrupting entire industries. Platform-thinking triumphs company-thinking. Companies have to embrace platform thinking. In this session Wilbert will share his ideas about product design and what he has learned developing new digital products for and within large companies.

Bio:

**Wilbert Baan** graduated the Utrecht School for the Arts on concept development for digital media. He worked for the Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant/PCM uitgevers on (new) digital platforms and products. In 2011 he co-founded Somehow. A digital product design studio. Somehow helps companies to design and develop software products.

**2nd Speaker**

**Josh Michaels**

Summary:

**Finding the Intersection: Thoughts on Art & Tech:** Apple always says that the best products come from the intersection of technology and the arts, but where exactly is that? What does Apple mean? In this talk Josh will discuss a number of different challenges he's faced working at the intersection. From getting artists and engineers to work effectively together to exploring some of the economic and cultural issues they face. Josh will share his own personal story of coming into the art world as an engineer mixed with observations and lessons learned along the way.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
