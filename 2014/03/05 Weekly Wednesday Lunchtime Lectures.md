Our guest lecturer this week is:Â **Cesare Rocchi**

Topic:Â **Choosing a back end for your app: don't roll the dice!**

Lecture Abstract:

Although usually unnoticed by the final users, the back end is an important piece in the context of mobile application. In the past, building a back end meant renting some hardware or virtual machine, setting up the operative system, configuring the server, database, storage and writing the application logic. Nowadays great services and tools that allow to quickly setup a back end are spreading. I will provide an overview of the services which allow developers to integrate their mobile applications with back end functionalities and I am going to illustrate the features of BaasBox, an open source back end, and its SDKs.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Appsterdam will provide the bread and drinks. Please bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
