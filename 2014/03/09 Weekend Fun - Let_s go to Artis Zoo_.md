What better way to spend your Sunday than getting together with Appsterdammers, their friends and families to visit the oldest zoo in the Netherlands, in the heart of Amsterdam: [Artis](http://www.artis.nl/en/artis-royal-zoo/)! In town for mdevcon? What better way to end an awesome weekend than to join the fun?!

We'll gather in front of the zoo at 13:00, to get our tickets:

• kids under 3: FREE

• kids 3-9 years old: €16,50

• 10+ and adults: €19,95

We don't have an official tour planned, but we have some Artis addicts in our midst who are more than happy to show you around.

If you want to meet us later, get lost or for any other reason need to get in touch, contact Merel (phone: [masked] twitter: @SidelineNoob)

The zoo closes at 18:00

We hope to see you there!
