*Our guest lecturer this week is:* **Pawel Glowacki**

*Lecture Topic:*Â **Rapid App Development for iOS and Android from the same C++ or Object Pascal codebase!**

*Lecture Abstract:*

In this lecture,Â **PaweÅ‚** will demonstrate live how you can rapidly create native mobile iOS and Android apps from the same codebase, using C++ or Object Pascal programming languages, with Embarcadero RAD Studio IDE.

We will see how you can be ultra productive in mobile app development using reusable, high level components - that can be manipulated at design time - for building graphical user interfaces for different devices, working with sensors, embedding databases, communicating with cloud services and more!

The lecture will be highly interactive and attendees are encouraged to ask questions during the whole presentation.

See You on Wednesday!

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
