*Our guest lecturer this week is:***Â AlessandroÂ Vozza**

*Lecture Topic:Â ***Continuous Integration & Delivery Process in the Openstack Project Infrastructure**

*Lecture Abstract:*

The Openstack project (openstack.org) is the largest open source project and the one with the most vibrant community. Around it a vibrant community of developers have built an ecosystem of tools and process to tame the huge complexity of the interconnecting sub projects, and the lecture aim to describe the life of a patch in one of the Openstack projects, throughout her lifetime and thru a series of reviewing, automatic testing and gating processes.Â

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
