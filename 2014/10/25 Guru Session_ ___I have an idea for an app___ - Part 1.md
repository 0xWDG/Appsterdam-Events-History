Appsterdam is proud to announce a Guru Session that tackles the question **“I have an idea for an app, what next?”. **

This is the first of three workshops that match ideas to actual app makers. This first session geared to validate your app idea thru the lenses of market, business model, financial and technical resources. The aim here is to field-test your idea with peers while introducing you to the realities of app making. 

**Agenda:**

12:30-13:30 Lunch

13:30-13:45 Introduction

13:45-14:30  “The Gap Between Idea and App”

14:30-15:30 “Pitch Makes Perfect"

15:30-17:00 “Building A Business Model For Your App" 

17:00-18:00 Beer & pizza!

*“The Gap Between Idea and App”*

So you want to have an app. But what is an app? Apps are those handy little icons on your phone, that do something very simple but very useful when you tap them. How hard can it be? In this interactive session, Marion explains why it's a bit harder than that (and expensive!) to get an app idea realized. 

*“Pitch Makes Perfect”*

Tom van Arman from Tapp will introduce participants to the fundamentals of the app “Pitch Deck”. Ideas are a dime a dozen, execution is all that matters. Executing a successful app depends on how well you pitch your concept or sell your idea to your audience / potential users. Participants will have 30 seconds to field test their ideas by pitching to peers and receiving their crucial feedback. 

“Building A Business Model For Your App”

Daniël Horn from KPMG will be introducing participants to the crucial role of the “Business Model” when developing apps. During this talk we will walk through business models that work and through those that fail for applications. We will use the business model canvas as a take-off point but quickly go into what it takes to build an app with a business model.
