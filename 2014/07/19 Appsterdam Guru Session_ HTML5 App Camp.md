**Introduction:**

Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions. Best of all, we'll provide the pizza and beer!

**Description:**

Type: Hands-on tutorial, Time: 6hrs

Level: Beginner

Lee Boonstra from Sencha will introduce you to Sencha Touch and Sencha Architect. With this tool you can create awesome multi-device touch applications. During the workshop we will build the “ATM-Finder” utility app. By the end of the session, you will all have a working app running on your device.

This session will cover the following topics:

·      Working with Sencha MVC.

·      Retrieving external live data.

·      Making it look good with Sass & Compass.

·      Building the app for production.

**Prerequisites:**

Previous experience with basic JavaScript, JSON, CSS3 & HTML5 is assumed.

You will need to bring your own laptop with the following software to setup your development environment to work with Sencha Touch. You may already have some of them.

• A modern web browser • Ruby 2.0 • Sencha Architect 3.x

You can download the 30 day Sencha Architect trail for free: [http://www.sencha.com/products/architect/](http://www.sencha.com/products/architect/)
