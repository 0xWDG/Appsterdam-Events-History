Startup Weekend Amsterdam is coming up! Whether you are building websites or mobile apps, your Startup Weekend team needs to get a technology stack up as fast as possible, and you need to code & deploy & pivot easily. This is a special Guru Session for Technical attendees of Startup Weekend to get you started. Doors open at 17:30, we begin with Pizza & socializing, then (approximately 18:15) start the sessions:

• Hands-on introduction to Google App Engine (skip the servers, deploy your  Python, PHP, Java code straight to AppEngine) 

Hands-on introduction to Compute Engine (spin up virtual servers to host your webserver, Hadoop, MongoDB, etc)

• Overview of other Cloud Platform components such as BigQuery, CloudEndpoints. Discussion of architecture, global scalability. Q&A

At the end of the session you will have some projects & code running, will have activated the $500 credit that Google is offering to each Startup Weekend team 

While this session is focused for Startup Weekend attendees, Appsterdammers are also welcome to join, hack and eat pizza with us! (and hopefully you will sign up for StartupWeekend!)
