Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

Chris van Aart from 2CoolMonkeys will introduce you to Open Data for Android. By the end of the session, you'll have a grasp of the how to incorporate open data sets into a simple Android app. Best of all, we'll provide the pizza and beer!

**Agenda:**

12:30: Doors Open

12:30-13:00: Welcome Lunch

13:00-17:00: Using Open Data for Android and hands-on exercises! 

17:00-18:30: Pizza and Beer

This session is targeted at developers who would like to learn how to incorporate open data into their Android app. Some Android experience is helpful, but we'll start small and give support if you are still an Android beginner. 

**Prerequisites**: 

Install [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html), bring an Android device and an USB cable. You'll also want to understand what a [Singleton](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_using_singleton.htm) is. If you are new to Android, we recommend at least running through an [Android Development Tutorial](http://www.vogella.com/articles/Android/article.html) and check out [some samples](http://developer.android.com/tools/samples/index.html) before the session.
