This week we have **Marco Jacobs**, with the topicÂ 

**Chips: The Engine Beneath Your Apps**

"In this talk we'll focus on the hardware inside the phone: the chips that enable the mobile user experience. I'll give an overview of the semiconductor industry, show typical phone chip architectures, their trends and how they influence the mobile experience. Here and there during the presentation, we'll take a quick peek into the future of the mobile phone."

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
