Note it now: On January 10, 17:00, you are invited for our New Year's Drink! 

Together with A Lab, Dutch Game Garden, and our new sponsor KPMG we will be awaiting you in our HQ in A Lab for a toast on 2014, food and great networking. 

As Appsterdammer, you can [work for free](https://github.com/Appsterdam/open/blob/master/resources/FreeWorkspace.md) at [A Lab](http://www.a-lab.nl/). KPMG will support Appsterdam to do a quarterly network event in the style of our [HQ House Warming Party](http://www.meetup.com/Appsterdam/photos/16881652/)! Together, we will start a knowledge exchange program. You can learn from KPMG and KPMG would like to learn from you; no further obligations. This and more will be happening in A Lab in 2014. We are looking forward to tell more about it on January 10. See you there!

Happy New Year!!
