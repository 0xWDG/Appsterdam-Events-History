In this lecture,Â **Jorg RegoortÂ **will be explaining the endless functionalities of the **Webapptool platform**, a great and user-friendly toolkit and CMS for creating and managing web apps.

With this toolkit designers and developers can develop content quickly for all mobile devices, while also giving the best possible, full app experience to the end-user. Web apps can look and feel exactly like a native app, because there is an icon on the homescreen and navigation is similar, but in fact they utilize the deviceâ€™s browser in full-screen mode.Â 

So, if you're an appbuilder/developer/addict just come by. Let's share ideas and discuss the Webapptool way of making apps!

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
