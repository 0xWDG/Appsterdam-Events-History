Learn how to make your own devices interact with others! You can bring your PI, Arduino and sensors... Join us for the¬†[Triggi](https://triggi.com/)¬†Discovery Day, a hands-on day to learn about Triggi Connect.

Keep an eye on this page as more info may follow!

**What is Triggi?**

Triggi is a free app for iOS and Android and it allows you to connect a growing list of smart devices, apps and services to each other. According to rules you have defined, Triggi makes things smarter. You can now add your devices to the mix!¬†

Currently, Triggi works with:

‚Ä¢ Philips Hue Lighting

‚Ä¢¬†Nest Thermostat

‚Ä¢¬†Netatmo Weatherstation and Thermostat

‚Ä¢¬†Toon Thermostat

‚Ä¢¬†Weather information provided by Foreca

‚Ä¢¬†Dutch EV charging stations, provided by [oplaadpalen.nl](http://oplaadpalen.nl/)

‚Ä¢¬†Location information (GPS on smartphone)

‚Ä¢¬†Date and time

‚Ä¢¬†Sunset and sunrise

‚Ä¢¬†Smartphone notification

‚Ä¢¬†Twitter

‚Ä¢¬†Facebook

You can find Triggi on both the [iOS appstore](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1125535051?pt=117972703&ct=TriggiDiscoveryDay&mt=8) and the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.triggi.triggi).

**Hands on Triggi Connect**

We'll kick off with an introduction to Triggi Connect, a 'maker channel' to facilitate makers and developers, enthousiasts, advanced users to quickly connect new stuff to Triggi, without having to develop a new channel first. Triggi Connect can be used for experiments, pilots or more permanent applications that do not justify a channel to be developed and/or maintained. With Triggi Connect, developers AND users alike can create 'triggs' containing both actions and conditions to interface with (yet) unsupported external hardware or -services.

**Examples**

On this day in Alab, demo material and smart devices will be available, as well as two examples on Github:

‚Ä¢¬†Motion Sensor - With a PIR and Arduino WiFi shield and you can detect and report movement. You can use that as a condition to trigger an action with Triggi

‚Ä¢¬†Sound Sensor - as above, based on sound level.

If the noise exceeds a specific level, a signal will be sent to Triggi Connect and you can connect it to an action.

Through Triggi Connect you can subscribe to events. While you can use the sound sensor to start blinking lights if the noise exceeds 60 dB, another Triggi user can access that condition for something else, for example to send an email and write the value in a Google sheet.

**So, bring along your laptop, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, sensors or any other devices you would like to connect to Triggi**.¬†

Triggi developers will be present to help you out with any questions you might have on Triggi and how to connect different devices to each other.
