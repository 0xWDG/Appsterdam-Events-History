Appsterdam is co-organizing [Nerderlands](http://nerderlands.com), the tech-holiday festival from Aug 14-21 at the Marineterrein. We work together with the [Amsterdam Makers Festival](http://amsterdammakerfestival.nl/) that is held on the Marineterrein too, from Aug 17-21.

On July 3, the Marineterrein is hosting an [OPEN DAY](http://marineterrein.nl/nl/nieuws/open-dag-op-3-juli-2016/)! You can check out the terrain and its innovative inhabitants. [Makerversity Amsterdam](http://makerversity.org/amsterdam/) for example, the maker's co-work space that offers large desks and shares facilities like 3D printers. Makerversity will also participate in the Makers Festival.
