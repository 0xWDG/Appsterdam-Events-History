We'll prepare something extra special during this Lunchtime Lecture, [Nerderlands](http://nerderlands.com/) edition, as Eddie Codel is here with us especially for the festival.

This is a lunchtime event, so we share lunch in the spirit of Appsterdam. Bring something to share, and we'll provide the bread.

In case you cannot make it, there is another chance if you're a drone lover! Join us on Friday August 19 at Vondel CS:
