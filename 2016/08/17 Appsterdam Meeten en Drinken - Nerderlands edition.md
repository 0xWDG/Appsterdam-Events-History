ONE TIME CHANGE OF LOCATION!

This Meeten en Drinken will take place at Pension Homeland on the Marineterrein and will be combined with a live broadcast of Top Names - [Nerderlands](http://www.nerderlands.com) edition. [Top Names](http://fastmovingtargets.nl/show/top-names/) is a weekly talkshow by Erwin Blom and Roeland Stekelenburg on the impact of digitization.

Meeten en Drinken is the opportunity to meet your fellow Appsterdammers in a relaxed setting. Get to know members of the community, meet a potential business partner, bring your app to share with others, exchange ideas with like-minded people... No talks are ever scheduled and everyone is always welcome to join.

So come join us! This time we are there from 7:30 PM. The livestream starts at around 8.30PM.
