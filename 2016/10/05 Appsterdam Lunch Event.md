*Appsterdam Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures and Pitch Club are now merged to become Appsterdam Lunch Event, a daytime networking event that makes it easier to get to know people in the Appsterdam community.*

Appsterdam Lunch Event is a technology-themed pitch training and networking event. Introduce yourself to the room with a one-minute elevator pitch and get feedback from the host, then chat and enjoy lunch with your fellow nerds.

This is a lunchtime event, so we share lunch in the spirit of Appsterdam. Bring something to share, and we'll provide the bread.

If you would like to make a day of it, you are welcome to bring your laptop and sit in our free workspace provided by A Lab, then join us for evening drinks at Cafe Bax. Everyone is welcome regardless of technical skill. To us, App Makers are engineers, designers, marketeers, lawyers, testers, or anyone else involved with the application of technology.

12:30 Welcome! Doors open

13:00 Introductory Pitches

13:30 Networking Lunch

14:30 Room closes, invited to work in our workspace.

19:00 Meeten en Drinken at Cafe Bax, Ten Katestraat 119
