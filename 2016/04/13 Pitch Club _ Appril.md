*When I used to work at Apple, there was a legend that if you were in the elevator with Steve, he would ask you what you do, and if you didn't have a good answer, he would fire you. I never believed that legend, but just in case, I always practiced by elevator pitch. Then I realized, how powerful is that, to always have an answer to that most common of questions: what do you do?*

Pitch Club is a masterclass on theÂ **60-second elevator pitch**.

Pitch your business, demo your product, or explain your life mission, and former Apple Design Award and Startup Weekend judge Mike LeeÂ will give you personalized, honest feedback, which should also help everyone in attendance.

Be warned: participants are welcome, but spectators are not allowedâ€”If you come to Pitch Club, you have to pitch!

This week's Pitch Club is part of Appril and will be held at the Jaarbeurs in Utrecht.

Pitch Club usually happens every 2nd Wednesday at A Lab in Amsterdam.
