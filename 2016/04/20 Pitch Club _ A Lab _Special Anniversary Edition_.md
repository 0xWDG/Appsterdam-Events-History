If you only come to A Lab once this year, today is the day!

On this date, five years ago, I wrote a blog post describing the idea of a kind of perpetual tech conference that became Appsterdam.

Also on this date, one year ago, I helped fund the first Awesome Foundation pitch contest in Amsterdam as a founding trustee.

What better way to mark these occasions than holding a special anniversary edition Pitch Club. Besides, last week was Appril, and next week is King's Day.

So! Being your idea, your life's work, your passion, your app, and show it off in front of your peers, then get valuable feedback from yours truly.

This is a lunchtime lecture, so we share lunch in the spirit of Appsterdam. Bring something to share, and we'll provide the breadâ€”and probably some cake or something.

If you're coming from out of town and would like to make a day of it, Appsterdammers are always welcome to bring their laptops and find a desk at our free workspace, then attend our evening event, Meeten en Drinken.

13:00 Kick-off

14:00 Program ends

14:30 Meeting room closes, invited to work in our workspace.

19:00 Meeten en Drinken at Cafe Bax, Ten Katestraat 119
