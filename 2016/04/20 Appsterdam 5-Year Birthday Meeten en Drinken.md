Can you believe it has been 5 years since Appsterdam started? Since our inception, so much has happened. We've connected people who might not have met before, we've collaborated with numerous communities, and we've increased our reach to well beyond the borders of the randstad.

Tonight we celebrate our successes and look forward to what is more to come.

Join us in the cozy cafe where Appsterdam was born. Put on a party hat and eat some birthday cake!

This is the place for you to meet your fellow Appsterdammers in a relaxed setting. Get to know members of the community, meet a potential business partner, bring your app to share with others, exchange ideas with like-minded people... No presentations are ever scheduled and everyone is always welcome to join.

Be sure to ask the waitress/waiter about their selection of seasonal beers and grab a snack to share with your friends. Then sit back and enjoy the company of your peers.

The time is always **Wednesday at 19:00**. The place is always **[Caf√© Bax](http://www.cafebax.nl/)**.

*Please note: It's a very casual event so people often don't RSVP or show up exactly at 19:00. So don't fear, you can *always* find Appsterdammers at this event!*
