Appsterdam Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures are at the crossroads of technology and communication. Different weeks have different kinds of events around that theme.

This week, Appsterdam co-founders Mike Lee and Judy Chen will share their impressions of CuraÃ§ao after representing Appsterdam at a startup event hosted by the Permanent Representative of the Netherlands.

There are many interesting opportunities for Appsterdammers in CuraÃ§ao to do business and share knowledge around entrepreneurship and technology.

Join us to talk about economic free zones, working vacations, drone-powered environmental restoration, and more.

This is a lunchtime lecture, so we share lunch in the spirit of Appsterdam. Bring something to share, and we'll provide the bread.
