Appsterdam Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures are at the crossroads of technology and communication. Different weeks have different kinds of events around that theme.

First of all, the lecture provides a stage for visiting experts. If something special is happening, it will say so right here.Â 

We do speaker training on alternating weeks, hosted by an experienced trainer.

Second Wednesdays are Pitch Club, where we learn how to explain our ideas.

Fourth Wednesdays are Idea Lab, where we talk about the ideas themselves.

Normally this week would be a lecture, but since I was sick last week, we are going to do Idea Lab thisÂ week instead.

Here's how this works: everyone with an idea for a real or imagined product gives a short pitch to me, Mike Lee, notorious mean judge. &gt;:-)

I will give some brief but insightful feedback, basically what I would tell you if you were pitching me as a judge.

Afterward, I'll invite the most interesting idea back on stage for more in-depth analysis.

We meet at A Lab, where Appsterdammers are always welcome to bring their laptops and find a desk at our free workspace.

This is a lunchtime lecture, so we share lunch in the spirit of Appsterdam. Bring something to share, and we'll provide the bread.
