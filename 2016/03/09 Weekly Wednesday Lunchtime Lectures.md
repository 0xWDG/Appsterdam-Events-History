Appsterdam Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures are at the crossroads of technology and communication. Different weeks have different kinds of events around that theme.

First of all, the lecture provides a stage for visiting experts. If something special is happening, it will say so right here.Â 

We do speaker training on alternating weeks, hosted by an experienced trainer.

Second Wednesdays are Pitch Club, where we learn how to explain our ideas.

Fourth Wednesdays are Idea Lab, where we talk about the ideas themselves.

Special Wednesdays are hosted by Amsterdam Smart City at Marineterrein or other locations around the country.

Otherwise, we just meet every Wednesday at A Lab, where Appsterdammers are always welcome to bring their laptops and find a desk at our free workspace.

This is a lunchtime lecture, so we share lunch in the spirit of Appsterdam. Bring something to share, and we'll provide the bread.
