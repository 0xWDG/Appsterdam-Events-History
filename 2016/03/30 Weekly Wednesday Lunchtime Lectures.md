**Interactive Legal Startup Session â€” Everything a Dutch Startup Needs To Know**

Joining us for a very special lecture, attorney Philip de Roos (startup lawyer and founder of legal tech startupÂ [Legalloyd.com](http://legalloyd.com/)) will take you through all the legal aspects of your business.Â 

In an interactive session, you will find out if YOUR business stands up to all the relevant legal tests.Â Convertible notes, cap tables, and privacy issues. Option pools, IP and SaaS Agreements.Â It will all be covered.Â 

If you have any questions you would like to deal with during the session, please submit them to:Â [[masked]](mailto:[masked])Â so that they may potentially also be dealt with in the session.

**Special Offer:**

As always, this lecture is FREE, but exclusively for the Appsterdam community, you can sign up for a Legalloyd's legal self service package (â‚¬9/month) and receive a free legal startup scan (normally â‚¬250).Â More information will be given during the Legal Startup Session.Â 

**About the Speaker:**

Philip de Roos started his career at Stibbe, subsequently worked for Google, and then founded his boutique law firm (clients include: Blendle, Ticketswap, Correspondent) and Legalloyd (a service for entrepreneurs, automating daily legal matters).
