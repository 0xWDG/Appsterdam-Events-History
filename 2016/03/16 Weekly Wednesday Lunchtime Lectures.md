This week we are pleased to welcome back Jorge D Ortiz Fuentes, to present a technical lecture about Apple's programing language, Swift.

This talk is about how a good architecture can help us to have a more agile, robust, and easier to work with application, by establishing parallelisms with the very well known problems of the Death Stars and the Starkiller Base.

Jorge will also explain why Swift is very well suited to implement such architectures and its advantages and disadvantages with Objective-C and other languages.

This is a lunchtime lecture, so we share lunch in the spirit of Appsterdam. Bring something to share, and we'll provide the bread.
