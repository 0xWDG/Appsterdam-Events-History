This is a special week. From October 21-29 it's Dutch design week. While that is in Eindhoven, a delegation of Canadian designers will visit this Appsterdam Business Chat. They are on a mission organized by the [Nederlandse Export Combinatie](https://www.nec.nl/en/agenda/22-tm-26-oktober-inkomende-handelsmissie-canada/) in collaboration with the [Dutch Design Foundation](http://www.dutchdesignfoundation.com/).

The mission's theme is' Dutch crossovers in innovation and creative industries' and aims to give the Canadian creative industry a showcase of Dutch Design and to tell about the added value of the creative sector for other sectors, and how the creative sector can contribute to solving global challenges.

There will be representatives of IDS Vancouver, BAI Architects, Gray Magazine, Inform Interiors, Emily Carr University of Art and Design, Metrolinx, IIDEX Canada, Toronto Design Offsite Festival, Design Exchange, the Dutch Consulates of Vancouver and Toronto, and the Nederlandse Export Combinatie.

So, welcome to meet the Canadian design world!! 

Appsterdam provides coffee and tea, and snacks, typically donuts. If you have special requests or suggestions, let us know in the comments.

If you would like to make a day of it, you are welcome to bring your laptop and sit in our free workspace provided by A Lab, then join us in the evening for dinner and drinks at Cafe Bax (the Canadians will be there too!).

Everyone is welcome regardless of technical knowledge.
