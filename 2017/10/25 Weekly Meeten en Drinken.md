This is a special week. From October 21-29 it's Dutch design week. While that is in Eindhoven, a delegation of Canadian designers will visit Meeten en Drinken. They are on a mission organized by the [Nederlandse Export Combinatie](https://www.nec.nl/en/agenda/22-tm-26-oktober-inkomende-handelsmissie-canada/) in collaboration with the [Dutch Design Foundation](http://www.dutchdesignfoundation.com/).

The mission's theme is' Dutch crossovers in innovation and creative industries' and aims to give the Canadian creative industry a showcase of Dutch Design and to tell about the added value of the creative sector for other sectors, and how the creative sector can contribute to solving global challenges.

There will be representatives of IDS Vancouver, BAI Architects, Gray Magazine, Inform Interiors, Emily Carr University of Art and Design, Metrolinx, IIDEX Canada, Toronto Design Offsite Festival, Design Exchange, the Dutch Consulates of Vancouver and Toronto, and the Nederlandse Export Combinatie.

So, welcome to meet the Canadian design world!! 

The designers plan to have diner at Café Bax, don't hessitate to join.

Be sure to ask the waitress/waiter about their seasonal beers and grab a snack to share with your friends. All Appsterdammers get *10% off* *the entire bill*, so order whatever you want to eat/drink. Then sit back and enjoy the company of your peers.

The time is always **Wednesday at 19:00**. The place is always **[Café Bax](http://www.cafebax.nl/)**.

*Please note: It's a very casual event so people often don't RSVP or show up exactly at 19:00. So don't fear, you can *always* find Appsterdammers at this event! Not sure you're in the right place? Just ask the waiters!*
