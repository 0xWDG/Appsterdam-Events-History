*Presentation by *Jorge D Ortiz Fuentes and *Potluck lunch ‚Äî feel free to bring something to share.*

**Refactor Your Way Forward**

Finally you bought into using an advanced architecture for your mobile app. You understand the advantages and are familiar with required knowledge. And you even got your management to give you the "OK, Go" to start spending time on that change. You have all that you wanted! Don't you?

Even though, you do understand how to create a clean architecture mobile app from scratch, soon enough you find out that you need a good approach to take your app from its current state to a well architected app. Your business needs to keep adding features. And your Objective-C code wants to be migrated to Swift. But you cannot afford (should not either) take the Big Bang approach: rewrite your code from scratch.

In this talk I will share some strategies, tricks, and gotchas about how to do the migration to an advanced architecture mobile app (mostly based on the clean architecture). I will cover strategies and tactics. And I will use an open source app as to show how to apply some of those changes to an already existing app.

I decided to prepare this talk, because this is the most often asked question when I do my workshop on hands on clean architecture for iOS.

*Presentation will be 60 minutes, with 30 minutes for questions.*
