Also, they will be demonstrating smart collars, biometric and behavioral data that helps keep the cows happy and productive!

They also have a shit load of data (= data about shit), and more:

• Arable land data

• Satellite data

• Agro data

• Farm management data

• Food & Nutrient data

• Soil & Land use data

With over 1.6 million cows in The Netherlands owned and operated by 18,000 dairy farmers there is increasing pressure to meet the many goals to move to more energy independence, continue improvements in livestock health and welfare, preserve grazing protect biodiversity and the environment.
