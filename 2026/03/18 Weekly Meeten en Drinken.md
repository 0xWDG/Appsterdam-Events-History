Ahoy, fellow Appsterdammers!
If you feel like it's time to start slowly getting used to being social again, maybe you'd like to warm up with your fellow makers, nerds, and other technology enthusiasts, who might better understand your specific interests and social style.
Join us in the cozy cafe where Appsterdam was born, at an earlier than usual time, to enjoy their legendary terrace and its ongoing attempts to comply with an ever-shifting landscape of rules — something many App Makers will understand!
Yes, even after ten long years and a pandemic, this is still the place for you to meet your fellow Appsterdammers, get to know members of the community, meet a potential business partner, bring your app to share with others, exchange ideas with like-minded people... No talks are ever scheduled and everyone is always welcome to join.
Be sure to ask the waitress/waiter about their seasonal beers and grab a snack to share with your friends. All Appsterdammers get 10% off the entire bill, so order whatever you want to eat/drink. Then sit back and enjoy the company of your peers.
The day is always Wednesday. The place is always [Café Bax](http://www.cafebax.nl/). The time, for now, is 19:00.
Please note: It's a very casual event so people often don't RSVP or show up exactly on time. But don't fear, you can always find Appsterdammers at this event! Not sure you're in the right place? Just ask the staff!
