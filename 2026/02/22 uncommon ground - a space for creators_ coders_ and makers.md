Welcome to our pop-up creators’ and makers’ space: an open, low-barrier environment where people of all disciplines can come together to create. Bring your own tools, whether that’s a laptop, a sketchbook, a typewriter, or a crochet kit and spend time sketching, making, coding, writing, painting, sewing, or building.

The concept is simple: no workshops, no formal program, just an open space where everyone is welcome to focus on their own project or get inspired by others. It’s about creating side by side, with minimal structure and maximum accessibility.
We can learn and inspire each other.

Whether you want to work on your side project, procrastinate your side project with a new side project, or learn a new skill, or just drink coffee - you're welcome to drop by anytime during 10-18h for as long or short as you want.

The event is intended to cross-pollination between different disciplines, spark fresh ideas, and inspire participants to explore skills outside their comfort zone.
Everyone is welcome, regardless of background or experience.
