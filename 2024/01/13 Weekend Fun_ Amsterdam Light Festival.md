### Amsterdam Light Festival (Edition 12)

Join us in a boat trip to go around 20 light artworks turn the historic center of Amsterdam into an outdoor exhibition space. From interactive lampposts, to a giant ball of yarn and from luminous fireflies to an installation that makes it seem like the water is burning. The works of Edition 12 trigger your imagination. Be sure to come and see them.
