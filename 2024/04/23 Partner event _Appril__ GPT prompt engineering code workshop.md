During this hands-on session, bring your laptop and immerse yourself in a practical exploration of LLMs. Go beyond what is possible for laypeople by integrating the powers of LLMs into code!

LLMs are very good at human-like things, like language and pattern-matching. They have enormous soft powers, like subtle intelligence, structuring text, and even producing code. Code, on the other hand, adds hard powers: loops, calculus, storage, variables, GUIs, etc. The combination of LLMs and code gives exponential powers!

We will use OpenAI API endpoints. Learn to build a simple yet powerful chatbot using text from your companyâ€™s website or other sources. Extract structural data and gain valuable insights into maximizing the potential of LLMs.
