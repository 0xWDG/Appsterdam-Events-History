Are you searching for an organization that can build, design, or assist with the launch of your app? Are you seeking specialists who are knowledgeable about the development process, whether it be low code, native, or web? Then come to our Mobile Lunch in Utrecht. Here, you can network extensively with professionals developing apps in the Utrecht region. We anticipate a mix of professionals from the app industry, from founders and developers to designers. This networking lunch is casual and unpretentious. If you find it intriguing, come a little earlier and sign up for the session on AI and dementia. After lunch, we’ll have a presentation on how to utilize ChatCTP for your users.
