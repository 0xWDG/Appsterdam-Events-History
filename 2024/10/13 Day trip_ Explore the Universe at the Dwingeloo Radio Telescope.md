üöÄ **A step closer to the universe**

On Sunday, October 13, 2024, we‚Äôre organizing a day trip with a luxury mini-bus from **Amsterdam** to the **Dwingeloo Radio Telescope**‚Äîa national monument and still an active center in radio astronomy today. When built in[masked], it was the worlds largest radio telescope with a 25-meter diameter. Today, the telescope is managed by volunteers from the **CAMRAS foundation** (C.A. Muller Radio Astronomy Station) and it is fully up to date. Several volunteers work professionally in astronomy and space science, such as at **ASTRON**, the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy. They develop innovative technologies like the LOFAR telescope and conduct fundamental astronomical research. The CAMRAS radio telescope is located on the ASTRON-terrain, in a radio-quiet nature reserve which normally is only accessible by foot or bike (we have a parking waiver). This day is organized by Martinus Meiborg, co-founder of Appsterdam, who has recently become a telescope operator at CAMRAS and also happens to be our bus driver.

üì° **What can you expect?**

In the rotating observation room of the radio telescope, you‚Äôll gain insight into the incomprehensible dimensions and aspects of the universe, guided by a scientific software engineer and guide who works in astronomy every day. Expect to dive into cutting-edge technology, clearly explained, with hands-on experiences:

* **Listen to pulsars**: The rhythmic signals of dead stars that spin around their axis in under a second.

* **See the expanding universe**: Learn how hydrogen radio frequencies reveal that the universe is continuously expanding and in motion.

* **Track satellites**: Witness how the 130-ton telescope tracks satellites passing overhead at high speeds. Learn about success stories, like how CAMRAS volunteers downloaded images from a Chinese lunar satellite, showing Earth rising from behind the moon.

* **Earth-Moon-Earth communication**: Discover how to send and receive radio signals via the Moon‚Äîone of Dwingeloo‚Äôs expertise.

* **Q&amp;A and more**: Enjoy a guided tour of the telescope‚Äôs components and explanations about its operations. You‚Äôll have the chance to ask questions about telescope software, such as coordinate systems and digital signal processing. You‚Äôll also learn about CAMRAS‚Äô open-source and data projects that you can get involved in. Be amazed by the technology that makes radioastronomy work.

üåç **Why join?**

Technology is revolutionizing our daily lives and work. Astronomy and space exploration were at the origin of many discoveries we take for granted today: data and signal processing, and satellite communication and software solutions.

This is a unique opportunity not only to learn from advanced technology but also to be inspired by the incomprehensible dimensions of our universe. Whether you‚Äôre working on mobile apps, machine learning, or data processing, you‚Äôll gain new insights.

üöå **Day details**

* **Date**: Sunday, October 13, 2024

* **Departure**: 10:30 AM from Amsterdam, at a location to be announced, in a luxury mini-bus with a maximum of 20 participants.

* **Program**: Bus ride including demonstrations in the telescope‚Äôs observation room, a guided tour of the telescope‚Äôs components, Q&amp;A, and more.

* **Lunch**: Bring your own lunch. Upon arrival, we‚Äôll eat at the Muller House, the former director‚Äôs residence on the ASTRON grounds, in the shadow of the radio telescope. We‚Äôll provide soft drinks and juices. Afterward, the tour and demonstrations will begin.

* **Return**: Late afternoon in Amsterdam, full of new knowledge and inspiration.
