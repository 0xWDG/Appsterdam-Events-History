üöÄ **A step closer to the universe**

On Sunday, October 13, 2024, we‚Äôre organizing an exclusive excursion for 20 participants in a VIP mini-bus from **Amsterdam** to the **Dwingeloo Radio Telescope**‚Äîa national monument and still an active center in radio astronomy. When it was built in[masked], it was the largest radio telescope in the world with a 25-meter diameter. Today, the telescope is managed by volunteers from the **CAMRAS foundation** (C.A. Muller Radio Astronomy Station) and it is fully up to date. Several volunteers also work professionally in astronomy and space science, such as at **ASTRON**, the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy. They develop innovative technologies like the LOFAR telescope and conduct fundamental astronomical research. The CAMRAS radio telescope is located on the grounds of ASTRON, in a radio-quiet nature reserve that is only accessible by foot or bike. This day is organized by Martinus Meiborg, co-founder of Appsterdam, who has recently become a telescope operator at CAMRAS and also happens to be our bus driver.

üì° **What can you expect?**

In the rotating observation room of the radio telescope, you‚Äôll gain insight into the Incomprehensible dimensions and aspects of the universe, guided by a scientific software engineer and storyteller who works in astronomy every day. Expect to dive into cutting-edge technology with hands-on experiences:

* **Listen to pulsars**: The rhythmic signals of dead stars that spin around their axis in under a second.

* **See the expanding universe**: Learn how hydrogen frequencies reveal that the universe is continuously expanding and in motion.

* **Track satellites live**: Witness how the 130-ton telescope tracks satellites passing overhead at high speeds. Learn success stories, like how CAMRAS volunteers downloaded an image from a Chinese lunar satellite, showing Earth rising from behind the moon, with the shadow of the moon over Chile during a solar eclipse (2019, see below in photo section).

* **Earth-Moon-Earth communication**: Discover how to send and receive radio signals via the Moon‚Äîone of Dwingeloo‚Äôs specialties.

* **Q&amp;A and more**: Enjoy a guided tour of the telescope‚Äôs components and explanations about its operations. You‚Äôll have the chance to ask questions about telescope software, such as coordinate systems and digital signal processing. You‚Äôll also learn about CAMRAS‚Äôs open-source and data projects that you can get involved in. Be amazed by the technology that makes radioastronomy work.

üåç **Why join?**

As a software developer or app builder, you know how technology is revolutionizing our daily lives and work. This expert trip will show you how astronomical data, signal processing, and even satellite communication depend on software solutions.

This is a unique opportunity not only to learn from advanced technology but also to be inspired by the incomprehensible dimensions of our universe. Whether you‚Äôre working on mobile apps, machine learning, or data processing, you‚Äôll gain new insights.

üöå **Day details**
