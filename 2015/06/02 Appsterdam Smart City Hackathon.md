**Hack the City and the Amsterdam Arena!**

Join us for the first Smart City Hackathon at the famous Amsterdam Arena. This is a unique opportunity for programmers, designers & business developers to solve real issues of smart energy, smart mobility and event experience.

We are co-organizing this hackathon with [Appril](http://apprilfestival.com/).

The event partners KPN, Huawei, FAN, Accenture, the City of Amsterdam and the Amsterdam ArenA are offering full access to open & live data sets, APIâ€™s, Internet of Things devices, and cloud based services allowing you to create and develop your own web or mobile solution.Â

**3 real themes**

The Appsterdam Smart City Challenge 2015 is all about turning urban challenges into opportunities. Teams are asked to develop working prototypes that tackle the themes of:

â€¢Â Smart Energy

â€¢Â Smart Mobility

â€¢Â Smart Stadium

Help us make the City and the Amsterdam Arena not only more enjoyable and sustainable, but also more safe, social and efficient. Do you have killer app idea using the ArenAâ€™s[masked] solar panels to charge your car? Maybe design a dynamic tariff parking app to solve big event traffic jams? Maybe a push notification system telling fans the best time and location to get a beer!Â 

Make a difference, get disruptive, and show how smart you can make our city!

**Exclusive Data:**

Donâ€™t miss the chance to access over a 100 unified data sets available exclusively to participants in BigQuery. That means you can do your mashups, explore and analyse all datasets in the same place. For the first time ever hackers have a one-stop-shop to static data, but also realtime data from OV, traffic, energy sensors, more. Some specific sets already exceed 6 million data points! You can see the entire set here: [http://bit.ly/ArenA_hack_Data](http://bit.ly/ArenA_hack_Data)

**Cutting Edge Technology:**

Be the first to try out the new LoRa embedded Glimworm iBeacons and micro sensorsÂ from the hot new startup Trakkies and KPN'sÂ Arduino GSM shields. Available only for this 48 hour event!

**Amsterdam ArenA**

This amazing venue allows hackers to code and program with a view directly facing the famous ArenA tribune and football pitch. Girls and Boys dormitories will be provided, and the overnight guests will have access to take take a shower in the Ajax locker rooms!

**Win â‚¬7,500 in PrizesÂ **

At the end of the Appsterdam Smart City Challenge, a jury will judge your solution. The 5 finalist of the Appsterdam Smart City Challenge will pitch their idea at the main stage of the annual Smart City event at the Amsterdam Arena on June 4th. After the pitches, the winning teams will be announced. Besides that, we may help to showcase your solution in Amsterdam and get your app in the app-store and promote it through several channels.

â€¢Â 1st Prize = â‚¬3,500

â€¢Â 2nd Prize = â‚¬2,500

â€¢Â 3rd Prize = â‚¬1,500

Get recognized during the live video-coverage and receive expert pitch training sessions to pitch your app to the judges or future investors. In short: this is a great opportunity to show your skills to the senior management of several innovative companies, the City of Amsterdam, the Amsterdam Arena and over 500 delegates of the Smart City event!
