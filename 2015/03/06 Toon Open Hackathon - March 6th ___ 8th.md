***Smart home technology, smart energy solutions!Â ***

Appsterdam is pleased to announce the Toon Smart Thermostat hackathon! Eneco, a leading supplier of sustainable energy in The Netherlands, is opening up their Toon environment for a weekend of new initiatives and innovation. Join us to develop apps for the fast growing community of[masked] Toon users.

The Toon Open hackathon is an entire weekend full of creativity, programming and discovery. Toon is Enecoâ€™s state-of-the-art Internet of Things thermostat. You will have full access to Toonâ€™s data on temperature and energy consumption: both real-time and historical data. Set the room temperature or control Smart Plugs and Philips Hue lights. Combine your work with Internet of Things devices, open data sources, open APIâ€™s or cloud based services.

Help consumers save energy and money or provide safety and comfort. Eneco may select your app by bringing it to the app-stores, making it available to over[masked] Toon users. Get recognized during the live video-coverage and receive expert pitch training sessions to preent your app to the jury or future investors. In short: this is a great opportunity to show your skills to the senior management of Eneco Energy, Quby Smart Home Appliances and their partners. And of course, we have some great prizes!Â 

During the hackathon here will be a number of break-out sessions and trainings for inspiration. Participants will enjoy delicious food & drinks, and even sleeping facilities are available for the overnight developers.Â 

All intellectual property of your creations remains with you, within the limits of Dutch law.Â 

**Innovation**

Choose any platform you like. iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, OS X, HTML5, Python, Ruby, Java â€¦ your choice. The possibilities are endless: wearables, Fibaro Smart Plug, Philips Hue, geofencing, integrate calendars or external open data sources, open APIâ€™s like NS or Google Traffic, data-analysis, prediction and provisioning, security, comfort, mood-analysis, insulation, energy-labels, voice activation & control...

**Prizes**

â‚¬3.500 will be awarded to the winning team, â‚¬2.500 to the runner-up, and â‚¬1.500 for third prize. Besides that, we may help you get your app in the app-stores and promote it through newsletters to the Toon community around the country.
