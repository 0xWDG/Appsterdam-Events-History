"HEADS UP! App users are taking more control of how their personal data is disseminated. Kim Smouter will be talking about the "doâ€™s and donâ€™ts" of developing apps with the new 2015 international data protection and privacy laws and how they will effect app development.

Kim L. Smouter is ESOMARâ€™s Government Affairs Manager since 2012. He is one of market researchâ€™s leading experts in data protection and privacy, helping non-experts get to grip with the legalese and technicalities. He is responsible for monitoring and lobbying politicians and data protection authorities around the world, but also advising ESOMARâ€™s members and the market research sector with regards compliance requirements. In his spare time, Kim runs a non-profit specialising in the cross-overs between technology and creative writing, using CMS and other web-based community tools to build digital creative communities."

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures are rebooting for the new year with a new format and a new host: Appsterdamâ€™s own Mayor Mike Lee.

For years, weâ€™ve welcomed international guest speakers and local App Makers alike to take the stage and share their knowledge on a host of technical and non-technical topics including computer languages, modeling, testing, design, marketing, business, philosophy,Â startups, strategy, and more.

New for 2015, weâ€™re adding more variety to the program, with a short talk from Mike, a live or pre-recorded lecture, group discussion, and an open stage where you can share what great things youâ€™ve been working on.

As before, weâ€™ll share lunch together. Weâ€™ll provide bread and drinks. Bring your ownÂ sandwich topping to share with others.

You will be welcome to work or hang out in the Appsterdam workspace for the rest of day and then join us for meeten and drinken in the evening. From now on, Wednesday is Appsterdam day!!Â
