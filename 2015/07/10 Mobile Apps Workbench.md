These days there is no shortage of mobile applications, also social ventures are discovering them. They range from community volunteering apps to apps for locating environmentally friendly products. Examples include: OWise, Heppee and our member Konnektid is building one. That is not to suggest that social ventures should be creating their own apps just because everyone else is.

So what are good reasons to build an app. When actually should you? And if you realise that the problem youâ€™re trying to solve is best solved via a mobile app, how do you go about it? Who to work with and what is the minimum investment you need? This is what weâ€™ll work on at the Workbench this month in collaboration with Appsterdam.
