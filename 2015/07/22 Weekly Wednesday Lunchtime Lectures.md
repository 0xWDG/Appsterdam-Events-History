Guest lecturer: Terence Barry from [BRAND-and-STORY](http://www.brand-and-story.com).

**BRAND IT, BUILD IT, SELL IT!**

What comes first - the brand, or the build? For many app developers, it appears to be the latter, with branding and marketing seen as a way to introduce a product to the market once it’s finished. Branding and storytelling specialist, Terence Barry, sees it differently:* “I’m a great believer that nothing should be begun until you have worked out its story - what it will ‘mean’ to a certain target audience. A product should be shaped to best serve the story that will sell it, not the other way around.”* On July 22nd, Terence will present a 1-hour keynote in support of his theory, using examples from Hollywood and other mass media to show how the products with the best narrative(s) always win out.

*Terence Barry began his career with BMW Group, helping create the stories that built the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands, before being headhunted to do the same for Bentley in the United States. A stint in Formula One was then followed by a career shift, where Terence decided to investigate the world of story more deeply, traveling to story festivals all over the world and working in Hollywood. This new knowledge allowed him to find the ‘DNA’ that exists at the heart of all great stories and to see an opportunity to bring this skill to the corporate world through his company, [BRAND-and-STORY](http://www.brand-and-story.com).*

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures are rebooting for the new year with a new format and a new host: Appsterdam’s own Mayor Mike Lee.

For years, we’ve welcomed international guest speakers and local App Makers alike to take the stage and share their knowledge on a host of technical and non-technical topics including computer languages, modeling, testing, design, marketing, business, philosophy, startups, strategy, and more.

New for 2015, we’re adding more variety to the program, with a short talk from Mike, a live or pre-recorded lecture, group discussion, and an open stage where you can share what great things you’ve been working on.

As before, we’ll share lunch together. We’ll provide bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.

You will be welcome to work or hang out in the Appsterdam workspace for the rest of day and then join us for meeten and drinken in the evening. From now on, Wednesday is Appsterdam day!!
