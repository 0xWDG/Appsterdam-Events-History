**TNW2015 Hackathon**

Every year The Next Web hosts a prestigious hack battle during [TNW Conference](http://thenextweb.com/conference/europe/). For 36 hours an exclusive group of international coders, some of the world's leading platforms and experts needed to build amazing hacks join forces in two days of coding, networking and learning from the API partners.Â 

Together with [NLnetLabs](http://nlnetlabs.nl/) and [VeriSign](https://www.verisigninc.com/en_US/innovation/verisign-labs/index.xhtml) we are looking for enthusiastic developers, to develop an app using the [getdns API](https://getdnsapi.net/). With getdns you can resolve IP addresses yourself without relying on your provider or the Google Name server (to mention something). You can do a security check with DNSSEC and receive a certificate that you can use to set up an encrypted connection between your app and the service. Nobody can see what is going over the connection; this is how you create a spoofing resistant solution.

During the 2015 TNW Hack Battle, we challenge you to build privacy enhancing new apps with [getdns api](https://getdnsapi.net/). Participating in the Hackathon goes by invitation and we have spots for 8 candidates. Your journey starts here. To win your spot: RSVP on on this meetup pageÂ before Friday April 10!

**About getdns**

Using the Internet is like sending picture postcards: everybody can read what you write on the back, including the postman. It is also like taking your shower in public without a curtain. Most apps expose you to surveillance; only a few apps provide methods to make your communications more private. So, close the shower curtain, stop using postcards: help users to be less exposed when they send Internet traffic to each other and innovate with DANE, the newest addition to the domain name system. The open source [getdns api](https://getdnsapi.net)Â was designed to enable all kinds of applications to build innovative security services. The [getdns api](https://getdnsapi.net) provides easy access to the global security infrastructure that is the promise of the DNS security extensions (DNSSEC) and DANE.

**Challenge Examples**Â 

Here are two challenge examples, or design your own:

Use getdnsapi in conjunction with an application API, such as Paypal's, fetch with DANE a public key of the person you are contacting (e.g. paying) with the API, and encrypt the messages that will be sent to her or him so that only he/she can read it. The UI should let your users know they've been protected this way.Â 

Use getdnsapi within an open source XMPP (jabber) client - fetch with DANE the public keys of the IM peers and increase their personal privacy. The jabber client UI should let the users know about their extra privacy. We have set up supporting infrastructure providing securely delegated domains for each participant and means to provision S/MIME certificates and PGP keys.Â 

Have a look at our [python, java, nodejs and C examples](https://getdnsapi.net/) to get started.

**Terms and conditions**

Travel expenses reimbursed for freelance app developers, students, and employees of non-profit organizations within Europe and The Netherlands (if living outside Amsterdam).Â 

This an application round, by signing up you have to opportunity to win a spot at the hackathon. VeriSign selects the candidates with a maximum of 8. In order to make their decision you may be contacted by NLnetLabs or VeriSign.
