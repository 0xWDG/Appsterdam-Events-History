**Tonight will be a regular night after all. We have to postpone our encounter with the Syrian developers one week. **

**The [IND](https://ind.nl/en) is crossing our plans. It turned out they are giving an information evening for the Syrians tonight.**

**So, see you [next week](http://www.meetup.com/Appsterdam/events/226062121/)?**

--------

Café Bax is where Appsterdam was born. Meeten and Drinken is the place for you to meet your fellow Appsterdammers in a relaxed setting. Get to know members of the community, meet a potential business partner, bring your app to share with others, exchange ideas with like-minded people... No talks are ever scheduled and everyone is always welcome to join.

Be sure to ask the waitress/waiter about their selection of seasonal beers and grab a snack to share with your friends. Then sit back and enjoy the company of your peers.

The time is always **Wednesday at 19:00**. The place is always **[Café Bax](http://www.cafebax.nl/)**.

*Please note: It's a very casual event so people often don't RSVP or show up exactly at 19:00. So don't fear, you can *always* find Appsterdammers at this event!*
