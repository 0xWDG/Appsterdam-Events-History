**Amsterdam is thriving.**Â 

Any given year over 5.5 million tourists are in Amsterdam using the same streets, squares and parks as itâ€™s residents.

Our great city hosts in excess of 300 cultural festivals every year. These civic gatherings create more and more challenges to maintain the harmony between Amsterdam residents and itâ€™s tourists.Â 

**Appsterdam isÂ the proud organizer the N8 Hackathon!**

The Museum Night Foundation together with its partners I amsterdam, Glimworm, Ziggo, booking.com, Yelp, van Gogh Museum, Scheepvaartmuseum, JCDecaux are calling all Appsterdammers to help find new ideas, tools and technologies for improving mobility, navigation and crowd management in the city. All app developers, start-ups, designers and other creative minds are welcome to join this unique event and makeÂ Amsterdam a even better city for people to live, work and visit.

**Not your typical hackathon**

We are Kicking-off the two week hackathon with the grand opening at non-other than the van Gogh museum. At this event you will hear from all the partners about their brand new data exclusive for participating teams. Here you and your team will be briefed and trained with the latest APIs and SDKs, beacons, sensors and various other technologies.Â 

**After this session, the teams get to work!Â **

Rack your brains and start developing winning solutions. Pitch your solutions at Museum Morning where you will be given suggestions from an expert panel how to improve your app before the opening of Museum Night.Â 

You will have only a half a day to perfect your project to a jury who will announce the results during the Museum Night
