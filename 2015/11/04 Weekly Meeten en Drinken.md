This evening, two young Syrian developers will visit Meeten and Drinken. One them is into iOS. At the moment they live at the refugee center in the "Havenstraat". They would like to meet Appsterdammers and see if they can steal your job, or deadly serious: find a way to start a life.

You are invited to share tips and thoughts. If you happen to be an Arabic speaker or could bring one along, that would make it extra cool. 

--------

Café Bax is where Appsterdam was born. Meeten and Drinken is the place for you to meet your fellow Appsterdammers in a relaxed setting. Get to know members of the community, meet a potential business partner, bring your app to share with others, exchange ideas with like-minded people... No talks are ever scheduled and everyone is always welcome to join.

Be sure to ask the waitress/waiter about their selection of seasonal beers and grab a snack to share with your friends. Then sit back and enjoy the company of your peers.

The time is always **Wednesday at 19:00**. The place is always **[Café Bax](http://www.cafebax.nl/)**.

*Please note: It's a very casual event so people often don't RSVP or show up exactly at 19:00. So don't fear, you can *always* find Appsterdammers at this event!*
