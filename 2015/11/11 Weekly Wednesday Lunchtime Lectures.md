Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures are getting ready for the new year with a new, more varied format that combines different ways of watching and giving presentations, hosted by Appsterdamâ€™s own Mayor Mike Lee.

For years, weâ€™ve welcomed international guest speakers and local App Makers alike to take the stage and share their knowledge on a host of technical and non-technical topics including computer languages, modeling, testing, design, marketing, business, philosophy,Â startups, strategy, and more.

Now weâ€™re adding more variety to the program. Different weeks, we'll focus on different things.Â 

The second week of the month is Pitch Club, where everyone gives a 60-second elevator pitch, and gets feedback on their technique, and the subtle art of pitching.

Other weeks we'll do speaker training, live or pre-recorded lectures, or an open stage where we can see each other's work and share feedback.

Maybe you have a great idea for something we could do together? Appsterdam is a self-sustaining community, so by all means, bring your ideas along with your natural curiosity.

As before, weâ€™ll share lunch together. Weâ€™ll provide the bread. Bring your ownÂ sandwich toppings or snacks to share with others.

You are also welcome to make Wednesday Appsterdam Day by working or hanging out in the adjacent Appsterdam workspace for the rest of day, then joining us at Cafe Bax for Meeten and Drinken in the evening.Â
