Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures are rebooting for the new year with a new format and a new host: Appsterdam’s own Mayor Mike Lee.

For years, we’ve welcomed international guest speakers and local App Makers alike to take the stage and share their knowledge on a host of technical and non-technical topics including computer languages, modeling, testing, design, marketing, business, philosophy, startups, strategy, and more.

New for 2015, we’re adding more variety to the program, with a short talk from Mike, a live or pre-recorded lecture, group discussion, and an open stage where you can share what great things you’ve been working on.

As before, we’ll share lunch together. We’ll provide bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.

You will be welcome to work or hang out in the Appsterdam workspace for the rest of day and then join us for meeten and drinken in the evening. From now on, Wednesday is Appsterdam day!!
