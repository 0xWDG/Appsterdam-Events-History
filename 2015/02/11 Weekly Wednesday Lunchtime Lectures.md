Appsterdam is organizing the [Toon Open Hackathon](http://www.meetup.com/Appsterdam/events/219667240/) from March 6-8. Toon is Enecoâ€™s state-of-the-art Internet of Things thermostat. Eneco is opening up their thermostat.

At this lecture, Bianca Anastacia with Eneco will introduce Toon and it's a global overview of the API, followed by a Q&A. (no technical details are reveiled yet) Here is a video for starters (in Dutch):
