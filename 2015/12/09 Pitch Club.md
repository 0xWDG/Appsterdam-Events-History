Pitch Club is a masterclass on the**60-second elevator pitch**.

Participants can pitch their business, product, or life mission, and the hostÂ will give personalized, honest feedback, that should generally help everyone hone their message.

Be warned: participants are welcome, but spectators are not allowedâ€”If you come to Pitch Club, you have to pitch!

Pitch Club is part of the Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lecture series, which focuses on, not just sharing great presentations, but also helping Appsterdammers become great presenters, and more effective communicators.

Pitch Club will happen monthly, every 2nd Wednesday.
