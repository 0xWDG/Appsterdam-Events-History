This week, Everlyn Liu presents:Â 

**BaBy Rules of developing your app**

Basic Business Rules of developing your app

You are an app maker and probably working on an awesome concept. First, you have an idea and then you start building it.Â  The next step is to develop your app further and grow audience. However, in order to do so, first you need to get other basics straight and question yourself:

â€¢Â Why did you start this?

â€¢Â What value does your app add?

â€¢Â Do people even need it, or how can you make them need it?

When you have a great idea it can be tempting to stick on it, build your tool further based on thoughts and assumptions, or based on feedback from friends. Nevertheless you want to avoid building an app that wonâ€™t be used. So in this lecture we will discuss Basic Business Rules of developing your app. Topics that will be covered slightly:

â€¢Â How to get the right feedback

â€¢Â How to add value with your app

â€¢Â How to operate in the market

â€¢Â Case examples
