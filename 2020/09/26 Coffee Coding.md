We are back!

Together with Miss Appril, organizer of Appril Festival and partner from Appdevcon, we will host a real live Coffee Coding Meetup. We will serve tea and have coffee from the machine.

The address:

Da Vinci Creatieve ruimtes,

Nieuwpoortkade 2a,

1055 RX Amsterdam

The gate of the entrance is closed at Saturday, so you need to give Jacqueline a call or me so we can open the door.

If you come by car, we have free parking at our courtyard!!

Due to Corona we have limited space or to be exact; 11 laptop spaces and we will open windows and doors for ventilations. Please bring your own extension cable incase...

The table is big enough to keep 1,5 meter distance from each other!!

There is place for only 12 people!

Call Jacqueline to open the gate: 020 -[masked] or Maike.

Whether you are a seasoned programmer or learning to code, wouldn’t it be cool to run by your challenge with another programmer when you get stuck? Or you have questions, or simply want to be in the environment of other like-minded friends while you work on your project?

Welcome to Appsterdam.

Bring your laptop and get feedback, encouragement and support, no matter what level you are at.

Share and contribute. Get guidance. Feel good.

All levels are welcome, so don’t be shy.

In the future we plan to have break-out sessions where we will have short talks on valuable topics and also conduct mini-hackathons where all of us get to participate and learn together.

Maike and Daniel are super committed to have an inspired group.

We start at 9:30 and end at 11:30, so some a bit closer to 9:30 to make sure you get the help you desire.

Just ask and maybe we can help you with:

• C++

• iOS Development

• JavaScript

• Rust

• Ruby

• Swift

• UI/UX Design (Adobe XD, Balsamiq, Keynote, Sketch, Figma)

Da Vinci Creatieve ruimtes,

Nieuwpoortkade 2a,

1055 RX Amsterdam

If you are interested to come, sign up and send me a message.

Sometimes people sign up and don't show up - in this case we need to know on forehand, because of limited places.

Also check your profile settings if you are allowed to receive messages. Sometimes I cannot send messages because of restrictions of your personal profile settings.
