If you're not racist, but the current moment leaves you scratching your head, maybe the problem is that we've been thinking about race the wrong way.

This online workshop is a judgment-free place to resolve inner conflicts, and finally get answers to your deepest questions, about race and racism.

You'll learn about where racism comes from, a better way to think about race, and how to avoid common pitfalls.

Navigating race and other diversity issues is an important skill for the 21st century. The smart choice is to take this opportunity and level up.

Rethinking Race is presented by Appsterdam, a non-profit foundation. Suggested donation ‚Ç¨20. Limit 12 students per session.
