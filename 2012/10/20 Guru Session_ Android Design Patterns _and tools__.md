Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

The consistency on Android UI and its patterns is one of the challenges of working with the platform. To help with this, Google created the [Android Design Site](http://developer.android.com/design/index.html) explaining how things should be. But the UI components are only available on newer versions of Android... What to do???

[Raul Portales of Plattysoft](https://twitter.com/sla_shalafi) will present the main UI paradigms that Google is pushing forward and discuss them - and also teach about the compatibility library and ActionBarSherlock that helps you apply these UI paradigms, especially the Action Bar even on older versions of Android!

In the hands-on exercises, each person will create a sample project that uses ActionBarSherlock and make use of some of this paradigms. You are encouraged to build something beyond the basic exercise, or even start migrating your existing app to this paradigm.

Agenda:

11:00-11:30: Doors open, sign-in

11:30-12:30: UI Patterns

12:30-13:30: Lunch break

13:30-17:00: Hands-on exercises: Build new, or adapt your old apps!

17:00-18:30: Pizza and Beer

The session is focused on developers that have basic knowledge of Android but want to build better looking apps (that should be all of you!) and that have not used ActionBarSherlock before. Designers are welcome too, and will learn from the UI discussions... but may want to team up with a developer during the hands-on exercises.
