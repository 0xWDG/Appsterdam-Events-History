This week Martine Spaans will talk about **Haute Cuisine of Mobile Games: Designing Games from Junkfood into Fine Dining**.

'You can sell a burger in a bun, but the taste will be much better when itâ€™s presented on a plate with silver cutlery. So looking at our own industry, why do certain games skyrocket off the charts while others remain undiscovered? What makes the difference? Is it the way the game has been prepared? Is the secret sauce making a difference? Is it the way the game has been presented? Martine will reveal how you can whet the appetite of players and publishers and how you increase your chances to receive a big tip!'

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
