This week Liou Yamane will talk aboutÂ **Tapping or swiping? Some thoughts about designing mobile user experiences**.

"During this talk I will focus on opportunities and challenges for the mobile user experience. What can we learn from desktop usability? What are the constraints and advantages of mobile devices? How do current mobile operating systems differ from the UX point of view? What are possible future developments in mobile UX?

At the end of this lecture the audience will hopefully understand what are key elements to a succesful mobile UX and what the future may hold for us."

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
