Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

Learn how to make a simple but functional API for your iOS (or Android) app using Rails. Thijs and Steven work at [80beans](http://www.80beans.com/nl) where they create rock-solid, test-driven rails apps - They will cover creating a simple UI and a JSON based API using Test Driven Development practices and help you get started on your own machine.

At the end of this session you'll have deployed your first working app to Heroku (free cloud hosting).

11:00-11:30: Doors open, dependency check.

11:30-12:30: Introduction to this Sessions Rails Stack and creating a blank slate app

12:30-13:30: Lunch break

13:30-17:00: Building an API, TDD-style!

17:00-18:30: Pizza and Beer

This session is targeted at any developers, mobile or web. If you can read code you'll be able to keep up with the Ruby... but to get more out of the session consider taking an hour to try this on this [Ruby on Rails tutorial](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html). Be sure to install Ruby on Rails before Saturday - you can find a good guide on [RailsGirls](http://guides.railsgirls.com/install/).

(For Bonus Developer Points: bring a copy of your mobile app that's waiting for a backend, and get it hooked up to your shiny new API before the pizza runs out!)
