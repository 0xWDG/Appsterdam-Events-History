**How to Build a Subversive Sensor+Data Network**

A cultural revolution is happening at the intersection of open source hardware, open data, and a billion people connected by the internet who can self-organize. You now have the tools available to you via extremely accessible and inexpensive platforms like [Arduino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino) and [COSM](https://cosm.com/) to embed data-gathering machines in the world around you and share that data in real-time with the world, enabling you and your community to understand your environment and affect your circumstances like never before.

Within the framework of the [AirQualityEgg](http://airqualityegg.com) project, learn how to:

Send data from internet-connected sensors to [COSM](https://cosm.com/), a web service for storing and publishing real-time data Generate graphs and other visualizations based on historical data Build real-time applications using websockets Use COSM to work with aggregated datasets from many sensors (millions of people accessing millions of sensors in real-time, it's possible)

Challenge:

Build a real-time visualization that incorporates data from multiple sources

Extremely unprofessional, a rampant anarchist, and will dance your ass off if given the opportunity.
