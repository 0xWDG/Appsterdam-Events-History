This week Marcel de Vries will talk aboutÂ **Building cross platform mobile Apps for iOS, Android and Windows**.

"This lecture is about delivering your apps to all major platforms with the least amount of effort, while not compromising on the user experience.

It will cover market adoption and the predicted future platform adoption projected by research firms.

I will discuss the myths about cross-platform development, the different techniques available for cross-platform app development (HTML v.s. Native v.s. Hybrid) and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. I will conclude with how you can decide what strategy works best for your app."

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
