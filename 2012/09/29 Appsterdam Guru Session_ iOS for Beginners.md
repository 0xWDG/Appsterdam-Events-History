Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

[Samuel Goodwin](https://twitter.com/#!/samuelgoodwin) from Roundwall SoftwareÂ will introduce you to iOS programming in the way programmers learn best: through hands-on practical exercises. By the end of the session, you'll have a grasp of the UI coding, connecting to network resources, and the Xcode IDE... and most important, the skeleton of your first application. Best of all, we'll provide the pizza and beer.

Agenda:

11:00-11:30: Doors open, environment check.

11:00-12:30: Objective-C exercises (in case you didn't read the tutorial)

12:30-13:30: Lunch break

13:30-17:00: iOS training and hands-on exercises!

17:00-18:30: Pizza and Beer

This session is targeted at developers who haven't yet learned iOS programming, or haven't yet flexed their muscles with it. Prerequisites:

(1) Your Mac with [Xcode 4.5](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed, which can be installed from the App Store.

(2) You will get a LOT more out of this session if you familiarize yourself with the basics of Objective-C. We recommend you run through [this tutorial](http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_objectivec/) beforehand.
