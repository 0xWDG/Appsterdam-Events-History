Are you a company looking to hire employees, contractors, or interns? Are you a recent graduate, unemployed, or an Appsterdammer simply looking for her next job opportunity? Then you've come to the right place! This Speed Networking event (modeled after the speed dating concept) brings you all together in a fun, fast-paced atmosphere. Each participant will leave the event with 7-10 contacts which have the potential to determine your next career move.

**PLEASE NOTE**: Let us know in the comments below whether you are a company who is hiring or whether you are seeking a job/internship. There are other companies who are hiring during the [2nd Speed Networking event](http://meetup.appsterdam.rs/events/81029372/), so feel free to sign up for both for more opportunities.

Entry into our App Ecosystem tent is completely FREE and you DO NOT need a PICNIC ticket to participate in our awesome activities! Check out the rest of the program for [Day 1](http://meetup.appsterdam.rs/events/81291222/) and [Day 2](http://meetup.appsterdam.rs/events/81291752/)!
