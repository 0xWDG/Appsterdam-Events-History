Please note: Entry into our App Ecosystem tent is completely FREE and you DO NOT need a PICNIC ticket to participate in our awesome activities! Check out the rest of the program for [Day 1](http://meetup.appsterdam.rs/events/81291222/) and [Day 2](http://meetup.appsterdam.rs/events/81291752/)!

Practice and show off your pitch skills in this fun contest at our App Ecosystem Tent during #PICNIC12. Each pitch contestant has 60 seconds to wow the crowd with their pitch on a new idea, business, or app. Each contestant will be critiqued on quality, originality, and delivery of their pitch by our three judges. The judges will choose three winners who will receive two lovely bottles of wine and a free one-hour consultation with an industry expert (i.e. one of the judges).

Please RSVP on this Meetup page if you are going to pitch. The order of pitches will be chosen at random. Be sure to prepare your pitch ahead of time. It's highly recommended that you also see Mike Lee's presentation called "The Most Important Minute Of Your Life," which he will present on Monday, September 17 at 14:00 in the App Ecosystem Tent.
