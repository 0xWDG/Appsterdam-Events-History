**Beyond Touch: Attitudes in Motion**

Touch screens are indispensable for modern smartphones. However, they contain many other sensors that could greatly enrich the user experience. Learn how to tame Core Motion, measure attitude (yaw, pitch, and roll), and put them to good use in your mobile apps. iOS programming experience is required. Bring your own laptop with Mac OS X 10.7 or 10.8, Xcode 4.4, iOS 5 SDK, and membership in the iOS developer program (to allow running apps on the device).

This guru session will be led by Mikey Ward, with Bolot Kerimbaev and Stijn Oomes assisting.
