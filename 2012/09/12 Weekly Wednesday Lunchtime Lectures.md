Today Matt Williams will talk aboutÂ **Best Practices to Optimize Your App's Website Performance**

As an app developer, you have focused your attention on making the app as fast as possible. But how will new customers find that app? Probably from your website. But if your website is slooooooowwwww, those customers may go elsewhere. I'll talk about 11 or so things you can do to make your site faster, resulting in more sales, conversions, etc. I'll use Yottaa as a tool to accelerate sites, but you could do everything on your own as well.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
