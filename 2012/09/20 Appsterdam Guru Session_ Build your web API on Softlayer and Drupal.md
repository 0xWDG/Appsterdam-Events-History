Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

Phil Jackson, Development Community Advocate for [Softlayer](http://www.softlayer.com/), will show application developers how to create a REST API that can complete complex tasks using existing projects and products. Using over 8 years of webhosting experience, the combination of The SoftLayer API, Object Storage and Message Queing as a case study, Phil will lead down the path of creating a simple API based in Drupal that will accept, normalize and publish video content.

And best of all, we'll round up the evening with Pizza and Beer!

Agenda:

12:00-13:00: Doors open, Lunch, Socializing

13:00-17:00: Session starts!

17:00-onwards: Pizza and Beer!

Attendees should have a working knowledge of PHP (or at least not be afraid of it), a conceptual understanding of Content Management Systems, and the ability to tap into the Force
