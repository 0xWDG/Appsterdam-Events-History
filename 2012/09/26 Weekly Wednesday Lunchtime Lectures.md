This week Julien Delange will talk aboutÂ **Be Geek, Get Fit**.

"Geeks are usually known for having a reduced activity level, except in

e-sport when they are usually good performers (remember all these

nights exercising your fingers on Quake III ?). From a nutrition point

of view, they are known for being addicted to pizza, sodas/beers,

processed food, and other not-so-healthy choices. As a result, many

computer addicts are overweighted and/or have some physical issues due

to a not-so-healthy way of life. On the other hand, avoiding all these

concerns is not that big of a deal ! Being geek and fit is not hard--it's just

a matter of making good choices.

How to lose weight, stay fit or build muscles? How to exercise? How

to avoid spending all your time at the gym and be the most efficient?

And what about doing sports after a long inactive period? This is

also what this presentation is about.

The presenter, Julien, is a geek guy who went on a diet some years ago. He

lost more than 70 Kgs in 18 months, and he exercises to stay fit.

All his plans were made by reading scientific papers, which he first applied to himself, and then called on his experience to give advice to many others. He continues to exercise to stay fit, but mostly for fun. But even with some

kilos off, he kept all his geeky habits and he still codes, plays video

games or even writes mobile apps ... for fun!"

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
