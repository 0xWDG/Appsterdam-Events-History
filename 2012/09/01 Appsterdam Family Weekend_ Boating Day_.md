**We're on a BOAT!**

Ahoy mateys!!

That's right ya'll. Get your sailor caps on! This Saturday we're going on a boat tour in and around Amsterdam! We have faith that the good weather will hold up so we can enjoy the beautiful sights our lovely city has to offer. Our boat captains are Jorn van Lieshout of [BounceSpace](http://www.bouncespace.eu/) and [Elwin Zuiderveld](http://elwinzuiderveld.nl/) and they are generously allowing us to use their two boats.

We are meeting at a dock next to NEMO Science Museum. The exact location is [here](https://maps.google.nl/maps?q=52.374057,+4.910669&ll=52.374083,4.910669&spn=0.001893,0.003098&num=1&t=h&z=19). In case you can't see the dock, make sure the satellite view is turned on in Google Maps. The exact coordinates are[masked],[masked].

The cost is €5 per person. Exact change is always appreciated! If you are bringing a child, please let us know so we can ensure that we have enough life vests. Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions or concerns. [masked]

See you landlubbers aboard!

**About the Appsterdam Family Weekends:**

Appsterdam Family Weekends are a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his blog: "Getting to know each other’s families will help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community."

Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more. We hope to see you soon!

Many thanks to our host, [Bouncespace](http://www.bouncespace.eu), for generously providing space!
