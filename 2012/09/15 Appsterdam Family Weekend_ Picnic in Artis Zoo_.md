**Details:**

How awesome is this? A picnic at the Zoo and an exclusive tour by an Artis Zoo volunteer, just for us! Bring some food & drinks to share with your fellow Appsterdammers (don't share with the animals of course!) and having a great time is guaranteed!

As the Artis Zoo is not free, we do have to charge for this event:

adults: € 20,50

kids: € 17,00

(for zoo members it's only €1,50 per person for the tour, both for kids & adults)

**About the Appsterdam Family Weekends:**

Appsterdam Family Weekends are a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his blog: "Getting to know each other’s families will help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community." Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more. We hope to see you soon!
