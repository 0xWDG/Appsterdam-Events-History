Are you a company looking to hire employees, contractors, or interns? Are you a recent graduate, unemployed, or an Appsterdammer simply looking for her next job opportunity? Then you've come to the right place! This Speed Networking event (modeled after the speed dating concept) brings you all together in a fun, fast-paced atmosphere. Each participant will leave the event with 7-10 contacts which have the potential to determine your next career move.
