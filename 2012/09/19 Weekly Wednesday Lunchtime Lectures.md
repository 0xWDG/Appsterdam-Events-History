This week Lassi KurkijÃ¤rviÂ from Sanoma Media will talk aboutÂ **Working with Big Companies**.

Sanoma Media is the biggest app publisher in the Netherlands. In his talk, Lassi will show how Sanoma is investing in mobile and what challenges a 120+ year old print giant faces when going mobile first. But the session is also about an exchange of views: what role can the largest media company in the Netherlands play as part of Appsterdam?

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
