**Get your aprons on, everyone! Let's get cookin'!**

[Kookstudio de Laurier](http://www.delaurier.nl/), the first cooking studio established in Amsterdam, has been catering and teaching people how to cook for 20 years. On January 21, Chef Kati will teach us Appsterdammers how to make pasta *from scratch*. Everyone will get involved in the whole process: prepping, making, cooking, and washing up. And the best part is… we get to eat what we make! In the end, Chef Kati will send us home with recipes for the dishes we prepared.

Our cooking class will be combined with a very basic Dutch lesson, lead by our very own Robert Shepard. He'll teach us the Dutch words of the ingredients we'll use as well as some basic conversational phrases. Emphasis will be on pronunciation, so this will be a great way to figure out exactly how to say such words as *grachtengordel*, *Schipol*, and *buienradar*. Even if you already speak Dutch, you can still help us clueless people out ;)

As with every Appsterdam Family Weekend, people of all ages are welcome to attend. The menu has been designed to be fun for kids and adults. Please bring your **€25 in cash** to pay on the day of the event. Beverages (soda, beer, etc.) are not included in the price so bring cash for that too. And fortunately, wine is as inexpensive as €15 per bottle. The normal fee for cooking class is €52-65 per person, so Chef Kati is really giving us a great discount.

See you all in the kitchen!

 

**About the Appsterdam Family Weekends:**

Appsterdam Family Weekends are a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his [blog](http://mur.mu.rs/?p=239): "Getting to know each other’s families will help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community."

Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more.

We hope to see you soon!
