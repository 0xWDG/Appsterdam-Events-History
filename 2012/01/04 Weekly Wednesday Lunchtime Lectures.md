**Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lecture Inaugural 2012**

It's a new year, which means it's time for a new run of Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures. Join Mike Lee, the Mayor of Appsterdam, as he kicks off the new year with an inaugural presentation. Join the fun, and don't forget to bring some food to share.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
