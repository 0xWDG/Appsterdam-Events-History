**Appsterdam & Waag Open Space** offer individuals the chance to host their own tech related event. Appsterdam and Waag provide all facilities, communication and infrastructure needed to host a high quality evening on a topic of your choice in one of the cities oldest and most beautiful buildings, the Waag on Nieuwmarkt.

This month **Gijs Molenaar** will host the first Amsterdam Computer Vision Meetup (ACVM). Computer Vision is a fascinating and fast growing field. The last years there have been major improvements in computer speed and therefore the ability to process images and video.

Also, a growing number of people are carying small supercomputers with integrated cameraâ€™s around in their pocket.There is a lot of knowledge and curiosity in Amsterdam related to computer vision, both from a professional and an artistic perspective. But since this field is so cutting edge this knowledge is protected and locked away inside companies and universities. The recent popularity and success of social tech meetings around the world learns us that a lot can be gained by opening up, meeting and sharing experiences and knowledge.

**For who?**

This event is the perfect opportunity for curious minds who want to find out more about computer vision and techniques. We also welcome professionals that want to meet fellow specialists and artists or entrepreneurs looking for inspiration. Lastly, it is an evening for employers and potential employees to meet.

**[About Appsterdam & Waag Open Space](http://events.waag.org/opendata/open-space/)**

Both Waag and Appsterdam share a goal in putting Amsterdam on the map as the new tech capital of the Europe and the world. We strongly believe that providing open frameworks is an effective way to build and strengthen a community.

Give people the means and they will make it into what they need it to be. Giving people the means to contribute to ecosystem of quality tech events is yet another way to engage people in the community.

Hosting a quality event can prove to be a costly exercise. How do you get a venue? How to you promote your event? How do get a sponsor? What does it cost? By helping people to setup their first event and plugging them into our infrastructure we believe we will create new group of highly engaged contributors to our community. We get to know the people with ideas, get an idea of what kind of events the community is looking for. Help people to be successful by sharing our knowledge, experience and network and create the next community leaders.Â We all benefit.
