Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

On January 16, Samuel Colak from [Im-At-Home](http://www.im-at-home.com/) will lead a hands-on session to deepen your knowledge of iOS. This session will teach you about push notifications and network polling on iOS, with a small detour to cover the server side components.

Hyves will host us at their headquarters, and best of all, we'll round off the afternoon with pizza and beer.

Agenda:

12:00 - Doors open, gather, eat lunch

13:00 - Workshop starts

17:00 - Beer, Pizza and socializing until closing time

This session is targeted at iOS developers. You should have XCode 4.2.1 installed, and be familiar with iOS and Objective C. There be a little server-side work in PHP, so it is also useful to download [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/).

We ask a â‚¬20 registration fee (payable onsite) to cover expenses and food. Space is limited to 20 people, so please notify us if you need to cancel before the session.
