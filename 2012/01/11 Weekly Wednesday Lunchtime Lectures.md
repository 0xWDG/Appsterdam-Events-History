This week Raul Portales will speak about¬†**The Road to Publish**

From having an idea to publish an app there are many things to consider and a lot of potential pitfalls.

The talk starts putting down the myth that you actually need an idea to continue about topics that go from product engineering to project management (even for small teams) and other common topics to software development and ‚Äúappcrafting‚Äù.**

**

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
