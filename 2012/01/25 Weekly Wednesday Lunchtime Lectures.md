Today Floris Van Alkemade will talk about **Preparing for Funding.**

Floris is board member at Layar and BoosterMedia and founder of Solid Venture, a venture capital company investing in innovative IT companies in the Netherlands.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
