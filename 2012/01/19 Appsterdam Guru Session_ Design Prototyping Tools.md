Appsterdam is a non-profit community of App makers improving craftsmanship, quality, diversity, cooperation, and professionalism in the development community, and making Amsterdam a capital city of App development.

Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

On January 19, Appsterdam and BNO will come together to give the second of a series of hands-on sessions created for designers, from any discipline, who are interested in developing an expertise in the design of Apps for mobile devices.

Our guru for the session is Matthijs Collard of [UNITiD](http://www.unitid.nl/), who will lead a deep-dive into UNITiD's prototyping tools and techniques for mobile Apps.

This session is primarily targeted at Graphic and Web Designers who want to learn how to make their designs “clickable”, but Developers and Interaction Designers who want to learn tools for fast prototyping are also welcome. To get the most out of the session, you will need [Adobe Fireworks](http://www.adobe.com/products/fireworks.html) (any version from CS3 up to 5.5.), it is possible to get  a trial version from the Adobe website. You also need a FTP program, such as the FTP client in Dreamweaver or [FileZilla](http://filezilla-project.org/download.php).

Agenda:

12:00 - Doors open, gather, eat lunch

13:00 - Workshop starts

17:00 - Beer, Wine, pizza and socializing until closing time

We ask a €20 registration fee (payable at the door) to cover expenses and food. 15 spaces are available to Appsterdam and non-BNO designers (signup on this page!), 15 spaces are available to BNO members (contact BNO if you are a member!)**
