Today Tommy Jarnac will talk aboutÂ **SEO for app makers**

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) gets a bad rap with software people. The goal of this lecture is to show why SEO is important, not evil and what you can do to drive people to your app through search engines.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
