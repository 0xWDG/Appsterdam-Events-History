Would you like to practice your public speaking and sharpen your skills? Please join us for the Appsterdam Monthly Speaker Training meeting. Participants will give a short speech and then receive feedback from the group.  

Every attendee will be expected to give a speech—no spectators, please. Speeches can cover any topic and will be limited to 10 minutes. Please come with a speech already prepared. All levels are welcome, from beginner to advanced. 

Before the meeting, we recommend you watch a video by Appsterdam Mayor, Mike Lee. This is a presentation about presenting, aptly titled "The Meta Presentation".  [http://youtu.be/6Jidkf7RggU](http://youtu.be/6Jidkf7RggU)

We’re limited to 5 people maximum per meeting, so please RSVP if you would like to come. The training will be held monthly on the last Monday of the month, so there will be an opportunity to attend a future meeting if this one is full.

Most importantly, the goal is to help you improve. Therefore you will be getting some constructive feedback on your presentation, so please come with an open and receptive mind.

Looking forward to seeing you there!
