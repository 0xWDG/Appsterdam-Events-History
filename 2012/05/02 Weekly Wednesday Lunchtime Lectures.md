Today Keren Zemer will talk aboutÂ **Power tips to get your app discovered and not forgotten**

The talk will cover these topics:

- The problem of apps discovery - background and stats

- Tips for developers (before launch, with launch, after launch)

- Retention activities

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
