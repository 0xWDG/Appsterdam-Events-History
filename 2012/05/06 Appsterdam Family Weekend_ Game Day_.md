Bring out your favorite board games, card games, tablet games, ANY games, so we can all have fun just playing games! We'll provide some beverages, but feel free to bring more drinks and snacks to share.

 

 

**Appsterdam Headquarters, directions by public transport:**

Take Tram 10 to the last stop which is Van Hallstraat. Walk towards the Westergasfabriek. After crossing the bridge, turn right towards the red brick buildings. The Appsterdam HQ is located on the left side of the first building you see, just past the main entrance to Pacific Parc Cafe.

If you get lost, please call Merel, [masked]

 

**About the Appsterdam Family Weekends:**

Appsterdam Family Weekends are a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his blog: "Getting to know each other’s families will help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community."

Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more. We hope to see you soon!
