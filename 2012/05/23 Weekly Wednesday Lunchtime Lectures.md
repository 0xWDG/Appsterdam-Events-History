This week features Craig Latta ([@ccrraaiigg](https://twitter.com/#!/ccrraaiigg)) who will talk to us about [Spoon](http://netjam.org/projects/spoon/): a minimal and extensible object system. The Spoon system provides straightforward collaborative development, deployment and discovery of Smalltalk apps. It runs unchanged on all popular computing devices today, including mobile phones.

Craig is a jack of all trades: computer scientist, musician, photographer, and more. His website is [netjam.org](http://netjam.org/).

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
