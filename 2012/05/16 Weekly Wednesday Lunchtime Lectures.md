This week features special guest, [Kirby Turner](http://www.kirbyturner.com/)!

"The Everyday Indie Dev"

The percentage of well known, financially successful indie developers is small compared to your typical, everyday indie developer. The everyday indie dev must find creative ways to stay in business without a breakout hit. In this talk, indie developer Kirby Turner talks about what it means to him to be independent. He shares lessons learned and mistakes made over the last 8 years, and he talks about the main motivation behind his company. Hint: It's not money.

Kirby ([@kirbyt](https://twitter.com/#%21/kirbyt)) is an independent software developer, author, and business owner focusing on Mac and iOS programming. Kirby has been programming since the early 1980s. He sells his own apps through his company [White Peak Software](http://whitepeaksoftware.com/), and he does contract programming when time allows. He recently co-wrote a book with Tom Harrington titled, [Learning iPad Programming, A Hands-On Guide to Building Apps for the iPad with iOS 5](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-iPad-Programming-Hands--Building/dp/0321750403/ref=la_B004FVC530_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1336940899&sr=1-1).

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
