Today's WWLL features our second recipient of the Appsterdam International Genius Grant, Will Hurley ([@whurley](https://twitter.com/whurley)) of [Chaotic Moon](http://www.chaoticmoon.com/). Whurley will talk about **How to be a True Innovator**.

"We live in the best time in the worldâ€™s history to be an innovator. The world is full of boundless opportunity and there's no reason to be sitting around and waiting. But we must changeÂ the way we look atÂ innovation. What are the principals of innovation, and how do you mitigate the risks? We will also explore some of the technical details of how we created some of our innovations--for example, the 'mind-controlledÂ skateboard'."

Â 

Bio: Will Hurley ("Whurley") is a technologist from Austin, TX, and a leading authority on open source, open innovation, and augmented reality.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
