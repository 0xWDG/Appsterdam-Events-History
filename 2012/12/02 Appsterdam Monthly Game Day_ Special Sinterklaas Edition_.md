Bring out your favorite board games, card games, tablet games, ANY games, so we can all have fun just playing games! We'll provide some beverages, but feel free to bring more drinks to share.

In addition to the regular playing of games, this month we're have some extra Sinterklaas activities which will be both lots of fun and very delicious!

We'll be making sculptures with *marsepein*, we'll teach you a Sinterklaas song, we're going to taste typical Sinterklaas candy and find out what we Appsterdammers like best and of course we'll tell you everything you want to know about how we celebrate Sinterklaas in the Netherlands!

Usually the Game Day is free of charge, this time we're asking you to make a donation with a minimum of 1 euro, to cover the costs of the extra Sinterklaas activities.

**About the Appsterdam Family Weekends:**

Appsterdam Family Weekends are a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his blog: "Getting to know each otherâ€™s families will help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community."

Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more. We hope to see you soon!

Many thanks to our host, [Bouncespace](http://www.bouncespace.eu), for generously providing space!
