**Details:**

This weekend we will celebrate the holiday season together with a White Elephant Gift Exchange followed by a potluck style dinner.

The White Elephant Gift Exchange is a light-hearted gift-giving game. If you are unfamiliar with this game, take a look at the gameplay here:  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_gift_exchange)... Please bring a wrapped item to contribute to the gift exchange. We encourage you to bring something from your home rather than having to shop for a new item. But it's really up to you what you want to bring–something awful, something silly, something awesome.. it's up to you!

After the Gift Exchange, we'll have dinner together, potluck style! This means that everyone is contributing to dinner by bringing food or drinks. To make sure we won't end up with just french bread and a few cases of beer (or any other ridiculous combination), we'll assign categories to all attendees. You'll receive an e-mail with what category you've been assigned after the RSVP closes.

So get ready to get in to the holiday spirit, we're going to have a blast!

**About the Appsterdam Family Weekends:**

Appsterdam Family Weekends are a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his blog: "Getting to know each other’s families will help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community." Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more. We hope to see you soon!
