This week, Simon van der Veen will talk aboutÂ **making a html5 web application**.

The focus of the lecture will be on the following client side topics:

Use kinetics.js in combination with backbone.js for the (rich) client (leveraging the html5 canvas to make a cool UI) Use node.js as backend and mongodb as datastore (everything in js, efficiency in using same language on client and server) Hook everything up to make a html5 web app - how does this compare to other solutions.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
