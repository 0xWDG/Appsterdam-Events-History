This weekÂ Chris LePetit will talk aboutÂ **Continuous Integration and Committing to Quality**

Chris LePetit is a Support Engineer with Atlassian and a hobbyist iOS developer. Being on the front lines when a customer experience fails tells us a lot about the assumptions made when we build software. Chris will take a look at some of the tools and concepts that Atlassian uses to commit themselves to quality, and why we do this.**

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
