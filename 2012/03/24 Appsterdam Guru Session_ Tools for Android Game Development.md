Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between developers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

On March 24, Raul Portales of [The Pill Tree](http://thepilltree.com/) will present a hands-on session on tools you can use for Android game development. He'll be assisted by members of Johan Pelgrim and members of [The Dutch Android User Group](http://www.dutchaug.org/events/51448682/?eventId=51448682&action=detail).

*When thinking about building a game for Android, one can write it from scratch. Or you can look for tools, libraries and engines that already exist so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.* *

* *We did that at The Pill Tree for both Chalk Ball and Space Cat, both games have different requirements and the solutions we found were also different. In this session I will summarize the strong and weak points of AndEngine and jPCT-AE and the uses you can make of them.* *

* *I will also give a brief explanation of other libraries that are interesting, such as ScoreLoop / OpenFeint for scores and awards and give a short introduction to virtual currency and incentivated ads.* *

* *After the talk, I will provide the people with the samples of both engines and we will play around with them.* The event is at the fabulous Mediamatic Bank location, and best of all we'll round off the afternoon with Pizza and Beer.

**Agenda:**

9:30 - 10:00 - Doors open, developers gather, coffee, environment check

This session is targeted at developers. Basic Android knowledge recommended, knowledge of 2D / 3D concepts is not necessary but will not harm. You will need to bring a laptop with the following software installed and ready: [Java 7 SE JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-se-jdk-7-download-432154.html), [Eclipse IDE for Java Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), [Android SDK release 13](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html), and the [ADT Plugin for Eclipse](http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html). Whew! Here's a [pretty good guide](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html) if you get lost.

We ask a €25 registration fee (20 if you have a Mediamatic membership) to cover expenses and food. Space is limited to 30 people, so please notify us if you need to cancel before the session.
