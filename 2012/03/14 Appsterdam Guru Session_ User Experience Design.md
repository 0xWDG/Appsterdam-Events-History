Appsterdam is a non-profit community of App makers improving craftsmanship, quality, diversity, cooperation, and professionalism in the development community, and making Amsterdam a capital city of App development.

Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

On March 14, Appsterdam and BNO will come together to give the third of a series of hands-on sessions created for designers, from any discipline, who are interested in developing an expertise in the design of Apps for mobile devices.

Our guru for the session is Ruben Bos of [Mangrove](http://www.mangrove.nl/), who will lead a deep-dive into designing strong User Experience (UX) for mobile Apps. At Mangrove he worked on apps like Txxi, BOVAG and Ministry of Defense. In this session he will explain UX techniques and best practices, largely based on lessons learned from years of web development.

This session is primarily targeted at Graphic and Web Designers to learn UX design for mobile, but Developers and Interaction Designers who want to improve their UX skills are also welcome. Be prepared to get your hands dirty as the workshop will be largely paper and marker based. A laptop or smartphone is not mandatory but advisable.

Agenda:

12:00 - Doors open, gather, eat lunch

13:00 - Workshop starts

17:00 - Beer, Wine, pizza and socializing until closing time

We ask a €20 registration fee (payable at the door) to cover expenses and food. 15 spaces are available to Appsterdam and non-BNO designers (signup on this page!), 15 spaces are available to BNO members (contact BNO if you are a member!)**
