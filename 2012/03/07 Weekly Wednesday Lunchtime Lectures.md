This week Saul Mora will talk aboutÂ **Runtime Foolery**

Messing with the Objective C runtime can be tricky at best sometimes. Perhaps method swizzling is too dangerous for your taste. Well, let's crank up the heat and do some really fun tricks in Objective C. Perhaps adding properties, and storing actual data, using a category. Or how about sending an object a message that isn't already there. We'll explore some of the more useful runtime hacks, and how to make them maintainable so that you can actually figure out what's going on later.Â 

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
