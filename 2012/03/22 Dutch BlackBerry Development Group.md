New: 4th Thursday of every month, the social get together for the [BlackBerry Developer Group Netherlands.](http://www.meetup.com/BBDevGroupNL/) By providing open sourced drinks (free) and getting together in a great Cafe, we can exchange our ideas and experiences of life and coding for the BlackBerry Platform.

If you enjoyed enough drinks, but aren't ready to leave yet, you can stay for diner (which unfortunately is closed sourced, i.e. coming out of your own wallet).
