Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

The format will be like the labs at WWDC: attendees should bring their own app security problems (with their code, if that's appropriate) which we can discuss. It'll be a series of one-on-one interviews, so while people are waiting they can either hack on their own stuff or listen in to the other discussions.

This session is primarily targeted at experienced iOS and Mac Developers who want to learn how to improve the security in their apps. 

Agenda:

14:30 - Doors open

15:00 - Workshop starts

18:00 - Workshop closes, head to Cafe Bax for socializing and beer!

We ask a €20 donation (payable at the door) to cover expenses.**
