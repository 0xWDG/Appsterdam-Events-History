**Details:**

This time Appsterdam goes to Utrecht! 

Merel and Jochem will take you on a walking tour through and around the city center, showing you the hotspots of this wonderful city. You'll learn about the culture and history of Utrecht while walking on the path less travelled, encountering some interesting places that even most locals don't know about. In between, we'll stop for drinks at some of the many nice bars.

At the end of the day you can choose to join for dinner at a lovely restaurant, or we'll drop you off at the train station.

For those of you traveling from Amsterdam Centraal Station, we'll take the 12:23 intercity service, so let's gather at noon in front of Starbucks. Then we'll gather at the meeting point in Utrecht Centraal Station (below the big LCD screen) at 13:00.

In case you get lost or want to join in later, please call Merel  &lt;a target="_blank"&gt;[masked]&lt;/a&gt;

 

**About the Appsterdam Family Weekends:**

Appsterdam Family Weekends are a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his blog: "Getting to know each other’s families will help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community." Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more. We hope to see you soon!
