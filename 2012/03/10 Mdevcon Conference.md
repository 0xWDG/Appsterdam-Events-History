On March 10 Egeniq is organizing Mdevcon, a conference for and by mobile developers working with mobile technology. There will be talks targeted at a specific platform and talks of a more platform independent nature. We welcome independent developers, freelancers and developers working for a company – It doesn’t matter who you are or where you work, if you work with mobile technology you’ll enjoy this conference...

With Appsterdam Speakers!
