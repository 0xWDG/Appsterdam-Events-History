This week Graham Lee will talk aboutÂ **Group Hug**

Even if you're working alone, you're not working alone. App Makers must work with their platform providers, framework authors (whether commercial or open source), hosting operators, customersâ€¦the list goes on. I'll discuss this ecosystem and how to maximise what you get out of it.

Graham Lee, Smartphone Security Boffin at the Lab, O2.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
