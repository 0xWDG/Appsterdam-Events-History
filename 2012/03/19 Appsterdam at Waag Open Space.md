**Open Data: is it still hot or not?**

During the past year a lot has been said about opening up data and finding new ways off applying data. What is the current state of Open Data? And what developments can we expect? Is Open Data still hot and can we see new opportunities in this field?

At this edition of Waag Open Space, we will try and answer these questions in a discussion with developers, hackers and representatives from the municipality of Amsterdam. We invite you to come and share your vision on Open Data with us!Â 

**Doors Open at 19.30 / Program starts at 20.00**

**About Appsterdam & Waag Open Space**

Both Waag and Appsterdam share a goal in putting Amsterdam on the map as the new tech capital of the Europe and the world. We strongly believe that providing open frameworks is an effective way to build and strengthen a community.

Give people the means and they will make it into what they need it to be. Giving people the means to contribute to ecosystem of quality tech events is yet another way to engage people in the community.

Hosting a quality event can prove to be a costly exercise. How do you get a venue? How to you promote your event? How do get a sponsor? What does it cost? By helping people to setup their first event and plugging them into our infrastructure we believe we will create new group of highly engaged contributors to our community. We get to know the people with ideas, get an idea of what kind of events the community is looking for. Help people to be successful by sharing our knowledge, experience and network and create the next community leaders.Â We all benefit.
