This week Rebecca Gomperts lecture will beÂ **Could apps help to overcome censure on abortion information?**

Women on Waves and Women on Web are sister organisations that work together to provide information and medical abortion to women in countries where abortion is illegal. The Â websites are censured at different moments and different places, and we are looking for solutions to overcome this censorship. During the presentation I will briefly introduce our work and the kind of censorship problems we have faced so far. After this I would like to ask the participants to join discussing possible solutions.Â **

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
