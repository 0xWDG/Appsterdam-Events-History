The Appsterdam Foundation is pleased to welcome you to the grand opening of our official headquarters and community hangout. Meet your fellow App Makers in the workspace at the intersection of creativity and commerce, where the next generation of great apps are being made.

With our new space at Westergasfabriek, Appsterdam as a community has become all the more concrete. Now you can bring your laptop and get your work done in the company of other smart people.

Through the kindness of the Westergasfabriek and the hard work of the VacantNL masterclass students from the Sandberg Institute of the Rietveld Academie, we have an incredibly unique cardboard workspace that is a metaphor for the ground-up, grass-roots, self-starting way the New Golden Age is being built, one app at a time.

Whether you're an engineer, a designer, a businessman, a marketeer, a lawyer, or just "app curious," come see the community of App Makers manifested in physical space. Come hang out, have some drinks, and chat with the Sandberg Instituut students about their project, the Appsterdam HQ.

Cheers,

Mike Lee, Mayor of Appsterdam
