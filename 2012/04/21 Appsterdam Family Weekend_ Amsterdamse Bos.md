This month we'll visit the organic goat farm in Amsterdamse Bos! (For an impression, [http://www.geitenboerderij.nl/](http://www.geitenboerderij.nl/) only in Dutch)

We'll meet at Amsterdam Central station in front of Starbucks at 12.30 PM, from there we'll take Metro 51 around 12:55 and transfer to Bus 199 to the entrance of Amsterdamse Bos closest to the goat farm, where we'll arrive around 2:00 PM.

They mainly have goats, but also some chickens, pigs and cows. There will be a lot for us to see and learn there! No need to bring drinks or snacks, they sell all kinds of drinks and snacks there, and you can even buy goat milk products to take home!

There's a lot to do for kids too, you can buy a children's arrangement on the spot, containing 2 bottles to feed the baby goats with, some food to feed the big goats, a snack, a drink and goat milk ice-cream. There's also a petting zoo and a playground.

In case you get lost or want to join in later, please call Merel [masked]

**About the Appsterdam Family Weekends:**

Appsterdam Family Weekends are a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his blog: "Getting to know each other’s families will help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community." Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more. We hope to see you soon!
