A continuation of the ["beginner's" course on April 14](http://www.meetup.com/Appsterdam/events/57441192/), we want to make sure you have a solid foundation set. If you have questions, which you might after a full day of learning how to program, please bring them. Other wise, we'll briefly go over items from the previous day. This session is more free form, and we can discuss any topic you like.

Saul Mora ofÂ [Magical Panda](http://magicalpanda.com/)Â will be supporting again, along with other Appsterdammers

11:00- 12:00 - Doors open, coffee, breakfast.Â 

12:00 - 16:00 - Get down to business: Questions, discussion, programming!

(Experienced programmers: if you really want to join, contact us to volunteer as an assistant coach)
