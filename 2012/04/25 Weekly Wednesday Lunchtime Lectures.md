This week Kendall Gelner will talk aboutÂ **The Pleasure of Data**

The lecture will be about exploring the state of the art in transforming raw data to pleasing visual images in the constraints of an application.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
