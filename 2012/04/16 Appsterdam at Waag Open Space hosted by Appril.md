**About Appsterdam & Waag Open Space**

Both Waag and Appsterdam share a goal in putting Amsterdam on the map as the new tech capital of the Europe and the world. We strongly believe that providing open frameworks is an effective way to build and strengthen a community.

Give people the means and they will make it into what they need it to be. Giving people the means to contribute to ecosystem of quality tech events is yet another way to engage people in the community.

Hosting a quality event can prove to be a costly exercise. How do you get a venue? How to you promote your event? How do get a sponsor? What does it cost? By helping people to setup their first event and plugging them into our infrastructure we believe we will create new group of highly engaged contributors to our community. We get to know the people with ideas, get an idea of what kind of events the community is looking for. Help people to be successful by sharing our knowledge, experience and network and create the next community leaders.Â We all benefit.
