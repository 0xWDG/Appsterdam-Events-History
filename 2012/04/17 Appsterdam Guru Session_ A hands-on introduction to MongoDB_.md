Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

MongoDB is a document-oriented database designed for scalability and developer agility. Chris Harris from [10gen](http://www.10gen.com/) will start by covering the core concepts of MongoDB and as a group we will get hands on and look at performing CRUD operations based upon a simple use case. One of the keys to delivering a successful NoSQL project is having the right schema for your use case. Chris will discuss schema design case studies and building a schema based upon use cases. The session will close by looking at scaling MongoDB via sharding and replica sets.

Since this is an evening session, we'll start out with Pizza and beer.

**Agenda:**

17:30 - 18:30 - Doors open, developers gather, beer, pizza.

18:30 - 22:00 - Session starts!

22:00 - Head over to Pacific Parc for beer and discussion!

This session is targeted at developers and database experts. Bring your laptop, we'll download & install MongoDB as part of the lessons.

We ask a €20 registration fee to cover expenses and food. Space is limited to 20 people, so please notify us if you need to cancel before the session.
