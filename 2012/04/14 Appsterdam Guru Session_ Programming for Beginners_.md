Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

Ever wonder what was going on in that confusing code that your developer, your tech partner or your spouse was so excited about? Now's your chance to find out! Saul Mora of [Magical Panda](http://magicalpanda.com/) will lead a full day workshop taking you from newbie to illuminated.  At the end of the session, you'll understand the basics and be able to write some basic code for websites.

And when we're done, we'll round off the afternoon with Pizza and Beer.

**Agenda:**

9:30 - 10:00 - Doors open, developers gather, coffee, environment check

10:00 - 12:00 - Getting started, Lunch Break, and Keep On Truckin'

17:00 - Pizza and beer!

This session is targeted at everyone except developers! Interface designers, business developers, graphic artists, lawyers, spouses. It's okay if you know a little Javascript, but if "null pointer exception" and "classpath" mean something to you, this isn't for you!

We ask a €25 registration fee to cover expenses and food. Space is limited to 20 people, so please notify us if you need to cancel before the session.

(Experienced programmers: if you really want to join, contact us to volunteer as an assistant coach)

(We'll also host a separate "[breakfast review](http://www.meetup.com/Appsterdam/events/57442892/)" on Sunday, if you want to followup and learn more)
