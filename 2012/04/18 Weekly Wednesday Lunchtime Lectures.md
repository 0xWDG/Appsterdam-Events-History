This weekÂ Paul Manwaring and Jonathan Carter will talk aboutÂ **Data-driven apps: creative process and discovery**

Drawing from their experiences creating data driven apps like Fiets Finder, Park Shark and Vistory, they will talk about the creative process, and mediate a discussion about data driven apps and designing the discovery experience.**

**

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
