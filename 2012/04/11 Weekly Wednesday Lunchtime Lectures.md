Today Willem Meints will talk aboutÂ **The Metro design language for app developers**

Microsoft released Windows Phone 7 in 2011 with a completely redesigned user interface with its own design language called Metro. Since then Microsoft has expanded the use of the Metro design language into Windows 8 and Xbox. In this presentation I will explain what the Metro design language is and how you can apply the Metro design language to your Windows Phone app as a developer.**

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
