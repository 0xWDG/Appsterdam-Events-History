This week Erik Romijn will speak aboutÂ **Making awesome apps with open data**

In the last year, open data in the Netherlands has grown tremendously. The government helps this not just by publishing mountains of free to use data, but even sponsors contests with significant prizes for the best open data apps.

We'll take a look at the Dutch open data landscape, covering what open data is, what kinds of datasets we have, open data contests, and what it takes to make an awesome app with open data. Erik will talk about the story behind his own prize-winning open data apps, and what to do with your apps after the contest.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
