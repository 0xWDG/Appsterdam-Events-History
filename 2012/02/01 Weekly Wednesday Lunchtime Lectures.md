This week [Paul de Medeiros](http://www.meetup.com/Appsterdam/members/36367882/) will speak about **the future and possibilities of Tablets in Education.**

Tablets arenâ€™t only great for games and ebooks, they also hold a great potential for education. In this lecture, Paul will talk about the role tablets can play in the schools of the future. From games to textbooks, from content distribution to user experience, you will learn everything you need to know about the future of education.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
