This week Tony Atkins will speak aboutÂ **Software Support in a Mobile World**

Tony Atkins works for Atlassian support, which supports tens of thousands of customers from around the world. Â Tony will be talking about tools that can make supporting your users easier, and about the perspective you need to turn support into a driver for growth for your mobile apps.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
