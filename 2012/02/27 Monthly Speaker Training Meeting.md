Would you like to practice your public speaking and sharpen your skills? Please join us for the Appsterdam Monthly Speaker Training meeting. Participants will give a short speech and then receive feedback from the group.  

Every attendee will be expected to give a speech—no spectators, please. Speeches can cover any topic and will be limited to 5 minutes. All levels are welcome, from beginner to advanced.  

We’re limited to 10 people maximum per meeting, so please RSVP if you would like to come. The training will be held monthly on the last Monday of the month, so there will be an opportunity to attend a future meeting if this one is full.

Looking forward to seeing you there!
