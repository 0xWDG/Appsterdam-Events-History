This week's lecture, Jan Peter Larsen, Managing Director at SENSE Observation Systems, will talk about *Context awareness from smartphones:*

*Smartphones carry over 20 sensors of different kinds that continuously monitor the state of the owner and his / her immediate environment. From the combination and interpretation of these sensors, it is possible to monitor human behaviour and even predict it. Sense provides technology to create context awareness from these sensors. The platform is available for other developers to use within applications, allowing context awareness to be an integral part of their solutions. Example applications are support apps. for people with depression or addiction problems, where based on their daily activities / patterns they get personalized and real time support, and we hope to even be able to forecast future relapses.*

*The talk will introduce the technology, the possible application areas, and I will give a live demo of the system.*

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
