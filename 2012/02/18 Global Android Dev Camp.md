On the weekend of February 18th and 19th there is an Android hackathon in Brussels, organized by the BruGTUG. This coincides with a Global Android Dev Camp happening the same weekend over Google+ Hangouts. Android developers from all over the world come together at more than 50 locations and write app code - nonstop! Globally, about 1,000 developers are expected - from Brussels to Berlin, to Warsaw and London, to Brazzaville, Kyoto and San Diego.

Learn about hands-on Android app development The event will include a beginner-level jumpstart session on the major features of Android, focused on 4.0 development, Fragments, and releasing to the Market. Android enthusiasts will be on hand to help and to answer questions throughout the weekend. Build with Us or Build Your Own Throughout the weekend, other GTUG members, locally or globally, will be building Android apps and sharing the code with you so you can code along. If, on the other hand, you already have a great idea for what to build, bring that idea with you to the hackathon, pitch it in the morning and form a team. Even better, bring along anything you can prepare ahead of time (sketches, designs, mockups, an empty template app etc.) and use the time, information and talented people provided at the hackathon to develop your idea into a working application, then share it with the world. At the end of the day, we'll invite you to share your Android app with the world. What Do I Need? We will provide facilities and experts to help you learn to use Android and write your application. Just bring your laptop, ideas, absolute concentration and enthusiasm to complete the mix. When and Where?Â  The Brussels hackathon will take place Saturday and Sunday, February 18th and 19th,Â from 10:00(am) to 03:00(am) the first day, and from 09:00(am) to Sunday 20:00. The location will not allow us to stay the night, so this will not be required or provided, but you are free to continue your work overnight at your own location. The deadline to finish your hack is Sunday 18:00.
