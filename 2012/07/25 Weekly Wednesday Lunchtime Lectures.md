This week John Fox of GroupSmarts will talk about **Alternative Paths To Living The Indie Dream**.

"The holy grail of 'living the dream' as an indie developer, has been much discussed. Unfortunately, there is no sure-fire, one-size-fits-all approach to achieving this lifestyle. In this talk, I'll discuss the many lessons I've learned over the last few years juggling work on a serious, long-term software project (MemoryMiner) with consulting engagements, weekly podcasting (iDeveloper Live); and public speaking. I've managed to avoid 'working for the man' while enjoying a healthy, balanced life with wife and child. You can too."

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
