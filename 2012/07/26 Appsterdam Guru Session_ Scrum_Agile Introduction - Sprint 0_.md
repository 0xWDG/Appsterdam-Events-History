Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

Your client asks you to work **Agile**! Your team tells you they want to **Scrum**! But what do they really mean? Do you just throw away the documentation and planning? Whether you're the client, on the team, or leading the team, Scrum requires structure and discipline to do it right and reach the great benefits of working Agile.

Julya van Berkel from Sogeti will lead an evening of Scrum education, hands-on exercises and games. You'll learn the basics of Scrum from both a client perspective and a Scrum Team's perspective. You'll also learn what separates Scrum/Agile from both Waterfall method and undisciplined cowboy programming. And most important, there will be pizza, beer, good people and fun!

**Agenda:**

17:00 - 18:30 - Doors open, start gathering, enjoy pizza and beer

18:30 - 21:30 - Get started with education and games!

21:30 - 22:00 - Wrap up, discussions and beer until the hosts kick us out.

This session is targeted at anyone involved in app making who needs to learn more about Scrum and Agile: The client, customer, business developers and product owners. Developers, UX designers, graphic designers, testers, team leads. There will be no technology component, only real-life exercises.

(If you're already an experienced Scrum Masters or Product Owner, you won't need this session. However if you still want to join, contact us to volunteer as an assistant coach!)
