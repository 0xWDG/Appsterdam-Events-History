The first rule of Speaker Club is talk about Speaker Club.

The second rule of Speaker Club is, seriously, talk about Speaker Club.

The third rule of Speaker Club is, if this is your first time, you have to speak.

Following the format of "The Most Important Minute of Your Life" concept by Appsterdam Mayor Mike Lee, participants will give a 60-second pitch of their business, product, or life mission. Mike Lee will then give a critique and feedback.

Speaker Club will happen monthly every 2nd Tuesday.
