Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

The [Kanban method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)) is a popular Agile method for managing work based on Lean and System Thinking concepts. It has a focus on visualising work, limiting the work to the team capacity and providing improved time to market and better predictability.

For this guru session we’ll be learning about Kanban by playing the [getKanban board game](http://www.getkanban.com/BoardGame). This game immerses us in a detailed simulation of product development and is a great way to learn:

How to use kanban across software analysis, development and testing roles How to measure and visualise key process metrics such as cycle time, cumulative flow and financial results How to handle fixed date and urgent work using Kanban How to manage a Kanban project and see the impact of management policies

This session is an early beta test and can accommodate **only 6 participants** so sign up early! If the session is successful we will aim to run a bigger session in the future.

**About the facilitator**: [Ben Hogan](https://twitter.com/#!/agileben) is a Lean/Agile coach & trainer visiting Appsterdam from Melbourne, Australia where he has been using Lean, Agile, Scrum and Kanban methods in large and small projects for over 10 years.
