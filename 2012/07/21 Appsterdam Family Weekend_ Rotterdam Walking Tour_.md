This month, Merel and her mom, both born and raised in Rotterdam will show you around the city they grew up in!

Those of you traveling from or via Amsterdam, Judy will gather the group at Amsterdam CS, in front of Starbucks at 11.15, where we'll take the train to Rotterdam at 11.42.

Those of you coming from other directions, Merel will gather the whole group at Rotterdam CS, in front of HEMA at 13.00, from where we will start the tour.

The tour will lead us by the more and less famous places Rotterdam has to offer, the art and statues on the streets and in the parks, the architecture, the monuments. It's going to be a good walk taking us through the history and culture of the city. Of course we'll have some stops in between to catch our breath and have a drink, please make sure you have some cash with you. At the first stop we're offering a little something to eat, but it is recommended that you already had a big breakfast or small lunch.

We'll end the tour on Stadhuisplein, the lively square a stone's throw distance from Central Station, over there we'll have dinner at Cafe Plein. Please send an e-mail to [masked] **before Thursday July 19** if you are joining for dinner. They offer a nice varied menu with very affordable prices.

In case you get lost, or want to join us later, please call Judy [masked] or Merel [masked]

**About the Appsterdam Family Weekends:**

Appsterdam Family Weekends are a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his blog: "Getting to know each otherâ€™s families will help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community." Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more. We hope to see you soon!
