Join us for our iOS hackathon. The goal is to build an awesome iOS app, and win the prize for the "Best App Submitted by an iOSDevCamp Satellite." If there is enough people we will divide ourselves in several groups, or you can bring your own group.

Developers, designers, and anyone who wants to join are more than welcome. We didn't win the prize last year, so now we're even more determined to win this year. For that reason, we are looking for other volunteers who want to help make short videos to create a bigger picture about the spirit of Appsterdam: sharing and collaborating.

If you plan on coming, please be sure to RSVP. It's FREE (except some little food/drinks costs) but we need a headcount. The location is Appsterdam Centraal, hosted by [Bouncespace](http://www.bouncespace.eu/), and is in the old Booking.com building.

HUGE THANKS to our sponsors!!
