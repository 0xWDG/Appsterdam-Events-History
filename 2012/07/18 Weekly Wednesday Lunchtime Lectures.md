This week Vincent Warmerdam will talk about **Intro to data mining with open source tools**.

Data mining is a recent concept in computer science and while still evolving, it has been reaping rave reviews. Many organizations all over have recognized the importance of data mining and have been using it to add a splurge to their income. No matter what field you are in it is important to know your data. There are many tools available like SPSS and SAS but they are expensive and limited.

In this small lecture I will discuss R, an open source tool for data analysis and statistics. I will explain how the tool works its magic through packages that are freely available and I'll also explain certain key aspects of data mining. I'll give some examples of what you could do with R as well (predict soccer outcomes, visualizing patterns).

Vincent a machine learning/econometrics graduate and teaches statistics at NBS Nyerode. If there are any specific (data related) topics you would like him to address please mail him beforehand at vincentwarmerdam [at] gmail [dot] com.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
