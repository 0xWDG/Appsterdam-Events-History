6 spots open for Appsterdammers!

KPN is innovating to make its services better and more fun. They are also looking for new services. KPN wants the functionality of its assets available to application developers via APIs. These are features like SMS / MMS, Location Based Services, Billing, etc.

They would like to know more about your experiences with respect to the API portal that KPN is creating.

On Monday, July 1 there is a creative session where 6-8 developers share their experiences with the KPN. This meeting lasts from 9:30 to 12:30 am, walk-in with coffee from 9.15u. Then there is a shared lunch. The program consists of a number of creative assignments preceding to the discussions.

In the week before the meeting you will be asked to do short preparatory assignments. With this preparation the group can go faster into depth during the session. This preparation takes about 20 minutes in total. You'll be contacted for a personal delivery of your assignments. After the session you will be kept posted on the progress of the project and there will be an evaluation.
