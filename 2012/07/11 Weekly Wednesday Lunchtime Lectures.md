This weekÂ Mathijs Kwik will talk about **Simulfy**.

Simulfy is a service for developers who want to include real-time, mutli-user cross device features in their applications. You can build your own service on top of their API or start with a couple of javascript libraries they developed. During the talk Mathijs will explain how their service works and what challenges they faced to create "shared state as a service" with Node-JS, Haskell (UHC to Javascript compiler) and Mongo-DB.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
