Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

In this session, [Nevan King](http://twitter.com/#!/nevaneva) will teach you how to add a map to your app, how to control the map, how to receive location information and how to add pins to mark places. In addition, you'll learn about some of the most useful pieces of iOS programming, including Frameworks, Delegates, Actions, Outlets and Views. By the end of the day you should have the experience to use maps into your own apps with confidence. Best of all, we'll provide the pizza and beer.

Agenda:

11:00-11:30: Doors open, environment check.

11:30-13:00: Start learning

13:00-13:30: Lunch break

13:30-15:00: More leaning

15:00-15:15: Short break

15:15-17:00: Afternoon learning

17:00-18:30: Pizza and Beer

This session is targeted at beginners. A little iOS programming knowledge would be helpful, but it's not strictly necessary. Prerequisites: Your Mac with [Xcode 4.3.3](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/index.php) (the latest version) installed which can be installed from the App Store. Please make sure to download it before the session, it's a free, but big download, so there might not be enough time to download it on the day itself.

You don't need an iPhone but experience with one is a bonus. You don't need to be a registered developer.

If you want to be ahead of the curve, you can read some of the documentation:

Location Awareness Programming Guide (somewhat technical)

MKMapview class (very technical)

Speakers Bio

Nevan has been programming apps using maps for several years. Every one of the apps he has released on the App Store (except that first embarrassing attempt) has incorporated a map. He loves the fact that in almost any city on the Earth that he wants to go, he can quickly get details of what's around, how to get food, how to find a friend or how to get home.
