This week, Cristian Scarlat will talk aboutÂ **A Rude Creativity Booster.**

"I'll talk about the graphic design, how it improved in Europe from "Good taste" in 1600 to a Science.

Good taste - Bad taste - Mine is better than yours. Evolution of information in Web - App - (Simplified Web) Presenting some techniques from Â Edward D. Bono and Lateral Thinking Â - Thinking outside of the box - And why it is needed when you deal with design. And I'll explain how important is to be direct, sometimes painfully rude even when you deal with your own design/ or your own life. I'll try to make people understand that this "Design" is not an intangible thing like a Fairy, and it can be reduced from Â Good Taste - Bad Taste to a mathematical evaluation. In the end how painful it is to be rude, and be wrong about a subject. And I'll offer a free Photoshop course [Â [24photoshop.com](http://24photoshop.com/) ] 24 hour session - 400Eur,Â to someone who can tell me the most Â R.u.d.e. (redefined) Â thing about my speech. :)"

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
