**Details:** This month, we invite you for the most exciting way to learn fun facts about the Dutch culture! By playing a game fit for all ages, you can win several prizes in 4 categories "Gezelligheid", "Fact or Fiction?", "Oud-Hollands" and of course "Treats".

Join in the fun and find out if you can learn something new at the same time! And who knows, you may end up going home with amazing souvenirs!

 

**About the Appsterdam Family Weekends:**

Appsterdam Family Weekends are a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his blog: "Getting to know each other’s families will help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community." Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more. We hope to see you soon!

Many thanks to our host, [Bouncespace](http://www.bouncespace.eu/), for generously providing space!
