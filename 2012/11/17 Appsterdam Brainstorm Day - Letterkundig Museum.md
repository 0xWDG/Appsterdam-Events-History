On Saturday, November 17, we will hold a creative brainstorming session for the [Letterkundig Museum](http://www.letterkundigmuseum.nl/) (Museum of Literature) in The Hague. How can creative technology help the museum showcase their vast assets? This is an opportunity for Appsterdammers to get involved in a creative production.

The Museum contains everything related to the work and personal lives of writers in the Netherlands. There are more than three kilometers of documents and objects, including manuscripts, children's book illustrations, love letters, and writers' portraits. This is the largest and most important collection of documents in the country with its 220,000 manuscripts, 65,000 photographs, 2,500 paintings and drawings, and much much more.

The [Children's Book Museum](http://www.kinderboekenmuseum.nl/) (in the same building) already has an interactive show. Today's mission will be ideas and strategies for the adults' section and online presence. The day's agenda:
