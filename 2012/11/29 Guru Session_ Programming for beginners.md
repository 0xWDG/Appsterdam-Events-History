Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

Nowadays more and more people need to get into programming, either to start a career as a software developer, or because they are eager to create new products and it's hard for them to find technical talent available.

In this session we will look at the basics of programming, using Ruby as a programming language since it's one of the most user friendly language while being the tool of choice for a vast amount of professionals. As you will learn as you get more experienced, once you learn the basic concepts of programming, you can pick any language or platform you want, so this session is addressed to everybody who wants to learn how to code, even if they plan to switch to another technology later.

**Agenda:**

17:30-18:00: Doors open, sign-in and set-up
