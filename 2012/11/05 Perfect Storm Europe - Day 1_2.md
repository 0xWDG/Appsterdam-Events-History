The Perfect Storm changes everything - for corporations, governments and citizens

There‚Äôs a perfect storm of disruption coming, we can‚Äôt do things the same way anymore. CIOs, senior managers, IT managers, business development managers, entrepreneurs - they all need to be out front, leading the change. It is about putting the ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù out to where the customers are. This is about flexibility and adaptability, working to new rules of design - making technology invisible by putting users at the centre of design.

Facebook, in just over two short years, has quintupled in size to a network that touches more than 800 million active users. More than 4 billion people around the world now use cell phones, and for 450 million of those people the Web is a fully mobile experience.

The ways information technologies are deployed are changing too, as the confluence of smart systems, social media, mobile and cloud computing reallocate technology costs and usage patterns. At the same time new ways are being created for individuals to consume goods and services and for entrepreneurs and companies to dream up viable business models. Smart phones and tablets are ubiquitous, and they are rapidly transforming how we all shop, connect, get around, and lead our daily lives. And Big Data makes sense of the exponentially increasing amounts of information in daily life. The phrase ‚ÄòPerfect Storm‚Äô describes this rapidly shifting technology environment ‚Äì raising serious questions for executives about how to help their companies capitalize on the transformation under way. Now it‚Äôs all about how to adapt management and organizational structures to meet these demands.
