It is Global Entrepreneurship Week next week and we want to celebrate this with our very own Appreneur Day on Thursday November 15th [masked]) at the Appsterdam HQ at Bouncespace (Weteringschans 28, Amsterdam).

What does it take to be a successful appreneur? How do you stack the odds in your favor? What good practices have you adopted and what do you avoid? What do you do wrong? How is appreneurship different from entrepreneurship? What obstacles have you faced and how did you deal with them? Where do you find your inspiration as an entrepreneur? How can Appsterdam support appreneurship more?

Come share your experiences and appreneurial stories - WINS and FAILS! The agenda is open, you decide the topics. Participate in discussions about what it means to be an appreneur and how you can be the best at what you do. Inspiring videos will spark discussions and we will do one or two simple excercises with practical tools like the business model canvas, that you can apply in your daily business (have suggestions?).

The program will be based on whoever comes to the event and their topics and stories. So you are invited to suggest content we should put on the agenda. Here is a hint of what we can do:

* talk about appreneurship,

* play with the business model canvas or other entrepreneur‚Äôs tools,

* discuss bits from ‚ÄúRework‚Äù or other inspiring books,

* watch and discuss TED talk videos,

* discuss business cases (bring your own if you like help).

It‚Äôs up to you! If you have suggestions for the program (topics, videos, excercises, business cases), please contact Casper Koomen at [masked].

We start at 9.30 and finish at 12.30. Entrance is free. Space is limited.
