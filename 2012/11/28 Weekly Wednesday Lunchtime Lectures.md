This week, Francesco Mattia will talk about **frameworks and tools he has learned as an iOS developer**.

"Hackers don't like to reinvent the wheel over and over again. Knowing and sharing the right tools can save developers a lot of time. At the end of the talk, the audience will be invited to contribute with their own experience."

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
