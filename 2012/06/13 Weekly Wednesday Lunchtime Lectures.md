This week [Nick Palmer](http://www.cs.vu.nl/~palmer) ([@dragodellaqua](http://twitter.com/#!/dragodellaqua)) will talk aboutÂ **Interdroid: Android Middleware for Distributed Communication, Offloading, Data Management and Sensing**

For the last five years, the VU University Amsterdam has conducted research aimed at enabling the next generation of novel application for smartphones in a project we call Interdroid.Â 

Working on the Interdroid project are myself, Nicholas Palmer, and fellow PhD student Roleof Kemp, under the supervision of Professors Henri Bal and Thilo Kielmann.

Our research has focused on distributed communication, computation and communication offloading, distributed data management, and context sensing, with the goal of making it easier to build truly novel application for Android powered smartphones.

In this talk I will give a brief overview of Ibis our distributed communication framework, Raven for distributed data management, Cuckoo for communication and computation offloading, and SWAN for context related applications.

I will then delve deeper into the SWAN system in order to provide an overview of how to use SWAN to build context aware applications, as well as discuss our current work aimed at bringing distributed sensor collection and artificial intelligence to the SWAN framework.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
