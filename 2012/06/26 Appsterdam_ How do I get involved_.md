*It's the people that make Appsterdam*, a phrase you hear more and more often. Not only is it true in the sense of our amazing atmosphere and the fast growing group of people who attend our events, it's also true in a very literal way. From the very first moment, Appsterdam has been run by volunteers.

Who are these volunteers? What is it they do? Why are they so passionate about it?Â Ever wondered what happens behind the scenes? Or even been wanting to help out yourself, but never knew how?

**Get the answers to all those questions and more on this volunteer night.**

Several of our core volunteers will give a short talk about what it is they do and why.Â Come and hear the stories about organizing events like Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures, Guru Sessions, Family Weekends, about our embassies, about capturing it all on video and much more!

Afterwards, there's time to socialize, ask the volunteers questions and have a drink together!

There's something to do for everyone who's willing, regardless of your skills and how much time you have on your hands. Come and see for yourself!

Huge Thanks to our sponsor [Bouncespace](http://www.bouncespace.eu) for providing space and refreshments!
