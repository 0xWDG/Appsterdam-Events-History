Are you in Amsterdam and want to see Appleâ€™s WWDC Keynote, but you didnâ€™t get a ticket? Apple doesnâ€™t stream it live, but weâ€™ve got the next best thing: come to Appsterdam Centraal in the BounceSpace building (aka Weteringschans 28 - the old Booking.com building) and weâ€™ll be showing it on a big screen on Tuesday morning (assuming Apple makes it available on iTunes).

Itâ€™ll be just like being in the overflow room at Moscone, without the expense of a WWDC ticket, the flights and accommodation! Youâ€™ll be surrounded by other App Makers and Apple enthusiasts, and weâ€™ll even provide coffee/snacks/etc.
