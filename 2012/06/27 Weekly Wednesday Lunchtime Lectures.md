This weekÂ [Mykhailo Kotsur](https://twitter.com/sotomajor_ua) will talk aboutÂ **Grown-up JavaScript with AngularJS**

"Surprisingly many web developers don't realize that Javascript ecosystem is not the same as it was few years ago, when building a single-page web application was considered risky business.

Those times are way behind. Modern javascript MVC frameworks are if not silver, but certainly solid bullets which every person who wants to use benefits of evolution should be aware of.

I'll tell you about challenges that happen when you build a single-page application, about REST interface, and certainly about one of such frameworks: AngularJS, created by hackers from Google keeping in mind best software development principles such as TDD and dependency injections. That's why writing with AngularJS is such a pleasure."**

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
