Today's Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lecture (#WWLL) features Almar van der Krogt ([@almar](https://twitter.com/#!/almar)) and his presentation, "Realizing a vision of virtual decoration." He'll use his app [PeRSoN.NeL](http://www.prsn.nl) as a case study to describe a journey into augmented reality in iOS apps. Almar will also discuss overcoming roadblocks and further implementation of 'virtual decoration.'

Here's what Almar has to say about himself: As a [Virreal Architect](http://virvie.com/) I develop visionary website and mobile concepts that stand out in terms of beauty and ambition. Whilst my years of experience in customer/user centric websites and internet applications ensure solid usable designs, my urge to incorporate non-functional (but contextually relevant) components adds to the overall user experience. Thus realizing lasting impressions."

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
