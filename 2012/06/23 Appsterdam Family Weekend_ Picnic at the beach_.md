This month, we hope the weather is in our favor, so we can have a picnic at Zandvoort aan Zee! We gather at Amsterdam Central Station in front of Starbucks, from there we take the 11:19 train to Zandvoort aan Zee. From there, we'll walk to the beach where we'll pick a spot left from the main access path to the beach.

If we all bring some drinks and food to share, we're going to have us one festive picnic! Also bring a towel, plaid or something else to sit on. To make it extra fun, feel free to bring games, or even a musical instrument!

In case you get lost, or want to join us later, please call Merel: [masked]

**NB: In case of bad weather we go to the Tropen Museum. Watch this space!**

**About the Appsterdam Family Weekends:**

Appsterdam Family Weekends are a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his blog: "Getting to know each other’s families will help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community." Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more. We hope to see you soon!
