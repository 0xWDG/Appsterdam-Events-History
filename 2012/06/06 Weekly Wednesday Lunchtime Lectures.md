This week [Igor Asselbergs](http://about.me/igora) will talk aboutÂ **Color usage in User Interface**

The talk will be about how to use color as a building block in the user experience. Color is a great way to structure information and offers keys to navigation. When used effectively, it can add considerable value to a user interface.

Igor Asselbergs, creator ofÂ [colorjive.com](http://colorjive.com/) andÂ [colorguru.net](http://colorguru.net/)

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform--computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
