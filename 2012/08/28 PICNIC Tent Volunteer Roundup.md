Appsterdam is hosting a tent at the PICNIC Festival this year, 17-18 Sept.

We need an army of Appsterdamers to come help with everything from serving drinks to greeting our guests and helping them feel welcome.

This meetup will be an informal meeting to gather everyone who's interested and talk about what you can do.

Please join us to find out how you can help make our tent a huge success!

For more information about the programming:

We look forward to seeing you there!
