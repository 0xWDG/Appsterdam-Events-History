Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

[Dennis Reumer](https://twitter.com/reumerd) of the [Blackberry Developer Group](http://www.bbdevgroup.nl/) will introduce you to the BlackBerry WebWorks platform, which can be used to develop applications in HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript and is much like PhoneGap. We'll get you started with the tools, and show you how to setup signing, test and deployment of your applications. After this Guru session you will know the full process from a-z and it's up to your imagination and your HTML5 skills to create some awesome Apps.

Bonus: BlackBerry has donated 2 Playbooks to use during the session for live testing, and we'll give them away at the end to support your development and testing efforts.

We'll round up the afternoon with an Appsterdam BBQ in the BounceSpace garden. As this session's participant you can join [the BBQ](http://meetup.appsterdam.rs/events/78183002/) for free!

Agenda:

12:00-13:00: Doors open, environment check.

13:00-17:30: Session starts!

18:00-onwards: Outdoor BBQ and Beer
