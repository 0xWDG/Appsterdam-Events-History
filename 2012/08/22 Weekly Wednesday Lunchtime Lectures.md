This week, Tara Ross will presentÂ **Why Amsterdam? How Great Cities are Vital to the App-Making Ecosystem**.

"We'll exploreÂ what makes Amsterdam a premier creative-class city--and the perfect place to base Appsterdam. We'll talk about how city planning and urban design have contributed to Amsterdamâ€™s technical and creative renaissance, and the apps and media that will help spread the word to other cities in the world."

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
