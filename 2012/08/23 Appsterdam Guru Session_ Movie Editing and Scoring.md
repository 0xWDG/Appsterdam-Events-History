Media literacy is crucial to presenting your message. Come learn how to work movie magic, with the free editing tools that are already lurking on your computer. Join us for a tour through the iMovie edit of the recent iOSDevCamp movie. The session cost is EUR 25.

If you enjoy editing, we can put you right to work on our weekly Wednesday lunchtime lectures. If you edit a lecture for us, you'll get a EUR 10 discount on the session price! We'll have a second session where we edit as many lectures as we can.
