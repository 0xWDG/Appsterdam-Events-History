This week Craig Latta will talk about "Case Study: a Distributed Object Database for the InnoViz Project"

The [InnoViz project](http://www.hum.uva.nl/circa-projects/projects.cfm/5B7A90D1-7C67-4550-B5FE2C63B900975A) seeks to quantify innovative hi-tech activities in the Amsterdam metropolitan area, through data visualization.Â For the initial dataset, the InnoViz team will collect data from various social media sources. We want to store our data using a simple network API that can be used by novices, while also supporting more sophisticated queries that run on the data directly. I will discuss the MagLev distributed object database and its supporting Ruby app infrastructure.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
