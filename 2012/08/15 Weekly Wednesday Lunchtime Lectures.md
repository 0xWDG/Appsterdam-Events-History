This week Dennis ReumerÂ will present his talk about **Get Rich - Develop forÂ BlackBerry**.

"Why developing for BlackBerry makes sense if you actually want to make some money. During this lecture, we will talk about the BlackBerry ecosystem and theÂ opportunitiesÂ that are available for all types of developers (HTML5, C/C++, Qt/QML, Flash/Air, Java), and why it might make sense for you to take a look at the BlackBerry Platform.

If your interestÂ is piqued by this lecture, please also keep your eyes open for the follow-up Guru session."

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
