Amsterdam, Appsterdam, and the Appsterdam 2 Launch Party Weekend are all family-friendly.

You might choose not to bring the kids to the bar on Friday, but you'll definitely want to bring them, and your favorite broodje topping to share, to the potluck brunch on Sunday, as the Appsterdammers and their families get together like we do every other weekend.

Share food, swap stories, and say so long to our guests as the sun sets on another glorious Appsterdam Launch Party Weekend.
