We'll start the Appsterdam 2 Launch Party Weekend the same way we started Appsterdam itself: over beers at Cafe Bax.

As you arrive to the city or finish your work week, relax and have a drink with your fellow App Makers at the one bar in town where you know people aren't talking about football.

If you're feeling peckish, Bax also has a skilled kitchen, whipping up everything from traditional Dutch bar snacks to some of the best chicken satay in Holland.
