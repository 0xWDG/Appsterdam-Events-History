The main event! Join the fun with Mayor Mike Lee and his special guests as they show you what we've been up to, and where we're going next.

This will be the debut of Appsterdam 2: Appsterdam Overwinter, as well as the world premier of "*Space Pirate in Creative Cities.*"

This short film adaptation of the story of the founding of Appsterdam can only be called fictionalized because "*farcicalized*" isn't a word.

On Stage:

Mike Lee (Appsterdam) Marco Bottaro (Sogeti) Dan Nacht (Ice Mobile) Mark Voermans (Microsoft) Jonathan Wisler (SoftLayer) Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten (The Next Web) Joris van Mens (Google) Marleen Stikker (Waag) Jan Gerard Snip (Sping) Lauwerens Metz (Appsterdam Delft) And moreÂ  Â
