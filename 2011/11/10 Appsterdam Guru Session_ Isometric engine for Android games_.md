Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between developers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

Hernan Pelassini and Martín Marconcini (Globant, [Nextive](http://www.nextive.com/) , FarmVille for iPhone, TinyTown App) are visiting Appsterdam this week, and will share with us their techniques to port Cocos2D style adaptation to LibGDX for use in Android games. This allows you to create maps dynamically instead of the static .tmx file that is required now. Their code for this will be contributed to the LibGDX community as open source, so this is your opportunity to have a sneak preview at it.

Hernan and Martin will lead you through

downloading the base project explain the theory and high level architecture of what we are about to do demonstrate and constuct a portion of the code answer your questions for the remainder time (~2 hours) eating pizza and drinking beer! This session is targeted at developers. No Android experience necessary, but you should be comfortable with Java. Please have  Eclipse and Android SDK installed.
