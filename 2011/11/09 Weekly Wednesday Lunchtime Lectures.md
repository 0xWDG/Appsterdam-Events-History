This week Hernan Pelassini will talk aboutÂ **Quality and innovation as a means to monetization**

The lecture will be non technical but with plenty of references to the current mobile development landscape, Do's and Dont's and personal experiences working on products that are currently on the app store. Hernan has worked on big titles like Farmille for iPhone, Tiny TownÂ and others.

Â 

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
