This week Jonathan Wisler from SoftLayer will speak about** “The Cloud” What is it and what is it good for?**

The hype factor around the “Cloud” is currently off the charts. There are a lot of marketing departments using and misusing the term. Jonathan would like to discuss what does cloud really means and what it is good for and how you and your customers can benefit from it.**

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
