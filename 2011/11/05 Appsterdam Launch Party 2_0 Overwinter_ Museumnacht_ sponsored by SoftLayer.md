The original Appsterdam Launch Party Weekend rather famously featured guided tours of the city. This weekend's launch party was specifically planned on the first Saturday in Novemberâ€”Museumnachtâ€”the only night when Amsterdam's famed museums stay open, turning the city into one of the biggest multi-venue, multi-genre nerd parties in the world.

Our original plan was to have people pay for their own tickets. Then [SoftLayer](http://www.softlayer.com/marketplace) swooped in and picked up the tab, so we've got over 40 App Makers going to Museumnacht for free."

**City Tours**

Presented to you by Knowmads are two tours through Amsterdam that will make you fall in love with our city!

Fortunately for you museum night is upon us and apart from the city there are a great many live performances, acts, music, expositions and events!

**What is Museumnacht?**

Every first Saturday of November, Amsterdam museums stay open from 7pm until 2am for the annual Museumnacht ("Museum Night"). Apart from seeing the permanent collections and temporary exhibitions, there is plenty more to see and do, also for non-Dutch visitors. On this 12th edition you can enjoy live music, DJâ€™s, dance, performances, film, special tours, food & drinks in the many museums of the city. For the Museumnacht you buy 1 ticket which gives you entry to 45 museums, free use of all GVBÂ buses and trams, and 1 free museum visit valid until December 31. For more English info we advise you to visit the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/museumnacht). We hope to see you on the 5th of November! [www.n8.nl](http://www.n8.nl/)
