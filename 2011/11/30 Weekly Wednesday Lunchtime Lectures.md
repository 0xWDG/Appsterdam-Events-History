This week Matteo Manferdini will speak about **Uncovering Git.**

Distributed SCMs provide a lot of advantages over the centralized ones, so developers are using Git more and more. Unfortunately most of the times they don't know the proper workflows and end using Git the same way they where using SVN. This presentation aims to uncover the widely adopted workflows to make the best out of Git.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
