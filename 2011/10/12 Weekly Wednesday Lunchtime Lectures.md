Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.

This week Erik Romijn will talk aboutÂ **Stop, drop and release - an introduction to minimally viableÂ products.**

Apps are based on ideas. Sometimes the ideas are awesome, sometimes

they're horrible. Often the distinction is not obvious. What can we do

to make it easier to make the distinction? How can we validate and

evolve our vision with less effort? And how do we avoid the pitfalls in

that process?
