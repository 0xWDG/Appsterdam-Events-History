Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between developers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

On October 15 we will give a hands-on Android session at the great Mediamatic location. It's meant for people who haven't learned Android, or haven't really "flexed their muscles" with it yet. We'll teach you in the way developers learn best: First we make sure you have the basic concepts at your fingertips, then we throw you in the deep end of the pool! That means you'll team up, pick an idea and start building an app, learning with your team while being supported by the facilitators. And best of all, we'll round off the afternoon with pizza and beer.

Hosts: Raul Portales of [Pilltree](http://thepilltree.com/web/index.php), Ronald van der Lingen of [Layar](http://www.layar.com/), Matt Feigal

Assistant Android Angels: Tony Atkins of Atlassian, Magnus Dahl

Agenda:

9:30 - 10:00 - Doors open, developers gather, coffee, environment check

10:00 - 12:00 - Getting started: Hands-on introduction to Android

12:00 - 17:00 - Lunch, "Hackathon" style guided learning with a team

17:00 - Pizza and beer!

This session is targeted at developers. No Android experience necessary, but you should be comfortable with Java (or at least not afraid of it). You will need to bring a laptop with the following software installed and ready: [Java 7 SE JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-se-jdk-7-download-432154.html), [Eclipse IDE for Java Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), [Android SDK release 13](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html), and the [ADT Plugin for Eclipse](http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html). Whew! Here's a [pretty good guide](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html) if you get lost.

We ask a €20 registration fee (payable onsite) to cover expenses and food. Space is limited to 20 people, so please notify us if you need to cancel before the session.

(NOTE: Because we got two new assistants, we opened a few more spots to RSVP - you can find the "bonus" by [RSVPing at the Mediamatic website](http://www.mediamatic.net/page/230719/en))
