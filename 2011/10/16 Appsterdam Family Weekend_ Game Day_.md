Appsterdam Family Weekends are a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his [blog](http://mur.mu.rs/?p=239):

"...it’s important not just to get the nerds together, but also to get our families together. When our families get to know each other, they will be able to build their own community, and their own support network....Getting to know each other’s families will also help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community."

Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more.

This weekend, we are inviting you to our NDSM hangout and bring out your favorite board games, card games, iPad games, ANY games, so we can all have fun just playing games! We'll provide some beverages, but feel free to bring more drinks and snacks to share.

Game Day will be at the Appsterdam Hangout at NDSM werf.

From Appsterdam: Take the NDSM ferry which leaves from the left dock behind Amsterdam Centraal. When you get off the ferry at NDSM-werf, make an immediate right onto Ms. van Riemsdijkweg. The Pannenkoeken boat will be on your right, walk past that, down the street, and make your first left onto Tt. Neveritaweg. Walk about 100 m and you'll see the Hangout is in a fenced lot on the right with some large piles of rubble in it. Go through the chainlink gate and you'll see the blue buildings towards the water. Our door is on the left. If you get lost, please call Judy at [masked].

Hope to see you there!
