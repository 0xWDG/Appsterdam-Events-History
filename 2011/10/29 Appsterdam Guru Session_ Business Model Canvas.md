As a developer or a designer you probably know this feeling: you have a great idea, wrote your first lines of code or created your first designs and somebody asks you "Great, but what is your business model?"

Many times the answer you have to give will be vague because you simply don't know or you have not completely thought it through. There is a very easy-to-use tool to structure your ideas and plot them on a so-called [Business Model Canvas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas).

Steven Zwerink (@szwerink) will facilitate a workshop where you will learn how to use this simple model for every new business idea. In an inspiring and creative session he will show you how you can use these models to create a business model for your ideas in less than fifteen minutes.

During this session you have the chance to create your own business model, share your new ideas with group of friendly Appsterdamrs and learn from Steven and each other. This way when the business model question comes you can answer it with confidence. See you all the 29th of October!
