Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.

This weekÂ Tim Akkerman will speak about **App Marketing**.

Tim is a business developer mobile at Sanoma Media. Tim will speak about how to market apps and will show some case studies.
