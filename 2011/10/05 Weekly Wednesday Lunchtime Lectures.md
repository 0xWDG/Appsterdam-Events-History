Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.

This week Alex Gekker will speak about:**Â Game changer: Gameful apps for health and wellbeing.**

**Â **With the proliferation of mobile, ubiquitous platforms in our everyday lives, applications for healthcare are a fast growing market segment. A growing number of peripheral devices such as wireless weighs or pulse sensors help turning our personal phones into personal trainers. Yet one of the basic tenets of user engagement on those platforms remains: the notion of games. In the light of upcoming firstÂ [Games For Health Europe](http://www.gamesforhealtheurope.org/), the talk will chart the different type of health games and gamification attempts, discuss the need for cooperation between developers and medical professionals, note the growing market of health applications for doctors and surgeons and try to answer whether "serious games" is an inherent contradiction.Â Â
