On Sunday June 31 the Amsterdam Reggae Festival (http://worldareggae.com/) is held.

There are 7 back free stage tickets available for Appsterdammers interested to help shooting a live registration around and on the main stage using a streaming app.

What do you need: An iPhone4 and a data plan that allows you to upload max 150MB, which is around 1 hour of recording.

We will do two sessions, one with a Nokia N8 (provided, in which you would have to place your SIM) and one with the iPhone.

We'll gather at the NDSM hangout at noon. You may want to bring earplugs.

Please RSVP also for waiting list. More events may come up.
