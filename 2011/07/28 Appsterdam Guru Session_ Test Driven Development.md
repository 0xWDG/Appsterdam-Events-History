Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between developers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.
On July 28 we will focus on a programming "meta" topic, a practice called Test Driven Development. TDD gives courage and leads to clean code and iterative design. In this workshop we will start with hands-on exercises of TDD, explain the benefits of this practice, and dive into some of the deeper challenges found in real life.

While the techniques apply to nearly all programming languages, for this session we will use Objective-C and MacRuby to illustrate our points and tackle some of the challenges of applying TDD to Objective-C. If you don't have a Mac, or are not an Objective-C programmer, please tell us that when you sign up. We will pair you up with someone for the hands-on exercises.

We ask a €20 registration fee to cover expenses and food. You will need to bring a Mac (or pair up with a peer), with the following software installed and ready: Xcode (available cheap from the Mac Appstore) and MacRuby 0.10 or 0.11. (http://www.macruby.org/downloads.html) Space is limited to 20 people, so please notify us if you need to cancel before the session.

This event is being sponsored by Apps for Noord-Holland (http://appsfornoordholland.nl) .
