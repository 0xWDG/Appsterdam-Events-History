Meet the Makers

Appsterdam at PICNIC is more than an app challenge. Meet the Makers and see what skills they have. Looking for developers? Find them at Appsterdam! Looking for work? Show what youÂ’ve got at Appsterdam and find your new job!

Developers will walk around with their iPad, laptop etc to show their work to you! These face to face presentations will be alternated by stage presentations and app launches. Do you want to join Meet the Makers? RSVP now and we'll stay in contact!
