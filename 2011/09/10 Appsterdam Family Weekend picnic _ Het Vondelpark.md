Join us for a potluck style picnic at the Vondelpark. With good weather we use the field right next to the Openluchttheater ( [https://www.openluchtt](https://www.openluchttheater.nl/plattegrond)... ) and in case of rain we can find shelter at the covered part of the theater. Please bring a plaid, beach blanket or anything else to sit on and something to eat. Don't worry about drinks, disposable plates, cups and cutlery, there will be enough of everything. The price is 2,00 for adults and 1,00 for children to cover the drinks and disposables. Please feel free to bring any games and/or musical instruments.
