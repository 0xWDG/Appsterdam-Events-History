Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.

Today Elliot Lee will talk about: **Lessons learned from 3 years in the App Store.**

Elliot is a mobile app developer from Los Angeles. His startup, Greengar Studios, also has a development team in Vietnam. Greengar's apps have been downloaded over 7 million times.
