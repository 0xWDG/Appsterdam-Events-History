**Join the hackathon at Appsterdam at PICNIC**

Go to September 14th to register for the hackathon! **Â **

**

**

What are the goals of three days of hacking? This hackathon combines open data with business! Open data will be supplied by the City of Amsterdam the business ideas come from the Sanoma app challenge. You can choose to make an app just with:

1.Â Â Â  open data

2.Â Â Â  the Sanoma input

3.Â Â Â  or you can combine these

Different input means different prizes available!Â  It is up to you to create THE multi-winning app!

**Wednesday 14 - 9 : Innovation**

At 10.00 you will be briefed by the City of Amsterdam and Sanoma, giving you a heads-up in what (not) to create. Directly after this kick-off, teams will be created wherein discussion will flourish for ideas for the winning App. After the winning idea has emerged, you can start hacking! Strive towards perfection, make your idea #winning and earn those well deserved prizes! Need a break in between? Just visit one of those very interesting presentations on stage, which are totally free for hackathonners!

**Thursday 15th : Construction**

Bring it on at a full day of hacking together! This is the day that you create the core of your app, the framework and all of the important bits (and bytes)! Some well deserved breaks can be taken whilst enjoying a nice key-note, or perform some creative exploring at the PICNIC terrain.

**Friday 16th : Publication**

In the morning hours you've got time for some last tweaks to your app, before you construct a mind-blowing presentation that is to be held to the jury in the afternoon. After each team presents their brainwaves and forthcoming marvelous apps, the jury will decide the winners and the prizes are rewarded! Hereafter, you are invited in the grand theater for the Vodafone Mobile Clicks awards.
