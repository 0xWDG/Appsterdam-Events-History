Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.

Â 

This week Dylan Evans will talk about:Â  **A UX map to navigate and avoid the Appsuckdom**

An explorerâ€™s journey through the UX world, calling into the main ports of UX and providing some travel documents to help you navigate and avoid Appsuckdom â€“ weâ€™ve probably all been there at some point.

As with any journey, the aim is to make it enjoyable. Â We start at the beginning â€“ planning your UX trip â€“ covering off some of the necessary concepts and documents for better UX. Â Our trip continues with building and testing the UX, and then into the life of the UX â€“ viewing UX as a service rather than as a bounded product. Â  Some costs will always be necessary with any journey â€“ UX is no different. Â However, there are many ways of significantly reducing these costs without sacrificing too much in terms of reliability. Â What about the users? Â See these as your travel companions â€“ always present in one form or another. Â At the end of our journey, experience is only represented as memories. **
