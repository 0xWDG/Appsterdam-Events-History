Today Dennis Rietmeijer will talk about **Apps for Architecture**.

Smartphones and pads are getting more intelligent every day. By using their sensors they interact with their surroundings and accommodate us. In the future mobile devices will be equipped more and more with different sensors and will become more human related and more integrated in our life. It is if they know our behaviors and sense our moods. By knowing this, they alter the state of our environment and even transform the perception of a building. And even transform the way we design buildings.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.
