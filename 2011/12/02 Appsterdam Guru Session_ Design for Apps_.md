Appsterdam is a non-profit community of App makers improving craftsmanship, quality, diversity, cooperation, and professionalism in the development community, and making Amsterdam a capital city of App development.

Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

On December 2, Appsterdam and BNO will come together to give the first of a series of hands-on sessions created for designers, from any discipline, who are interested in developing an expertise in the design of Apps for mobile devices. The sessions will cover subjects such as the role of designers in the App development process, navigating through an App/User Experience Design for mobile devices, the unique challenges of typography and layout on smaller screens, how to take advantage of built-in frameworks, among other topics.

Our guru for the first session is [Marcel Schouwenaar, interaction designer](http://nl.linkedin.com/in/marcelschouwenaar).

This session is targeted at graphic and web designers. We are going to design an app for an iOS device, so you will get the most out of the session if you have: a Mac with Keynote 2008+, an iPad/iPhone with [BlueFire Reader](http://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/bluefire-reader/id394275498?mt=8) installed, and way to transfer documents to your iPad/iPhone (through email, iTunes, etc)

Agenda:

12:00 - Doors open, gather, eat lunch (does Appsterdam bring the lunch?)

13:00 - Workshop starts

17:00 - Beer, Wine, snacks and socializing until closing time

We ask a €20 registration fee (payable at the door) to cover expenses and food. 15 spaces are available for Appsterdam and non-BNO designers (signup on this page!), 15 spaces available for BNO members ([contact BNO here](http://www.bno.nl/pages.php?page=4997#ref_1) if you are a BNO member!)
