This weekend we will celebrate the holiday season together with a White Elephant Gift Exchange and an all-you-can-eat pancake meal on the [Pannenkoekenboot](http://www.pannenkoekenboot.nl/locaties/amsterdam.aspx) (€15,60 for adults, €10,60 for kids aged 3-12). The White Elephant Gift Exchange is a light-hearted gift-giving game. If you are unfamiliar with this game, take a look at the gameplay here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_gift_exchange)... Please bring a wrapped item to contribute to the gift exchange. We encourage you to bring something from your home rather than having to shop for a new item. But it's really up to you what you want to bring–something awful, something silly, something awesome.. it's up to you!

14:30 Meet at the NDSM-Werf hangout

15:00 White Elephant Gift Exchange

16:15 Get on the Pannenkoekenboot!

From Appsterdam: Take the NDSM ferry which leaves from the left dock behind Amsterdam Centraal. When you get off the ferry at NDSM-werf, make a sharp right onto Ms. van Riemsdijkweg. The sign for the Pannenkoeken boat will be on your right. Walk straight past that, down the street, and make your first left onto Tt. Neveritaweg. Walk about 100 m and you'll see a fenced lot on the right with some large piles of rubble in it. Go through the chainlink gate and you'll see the blue buildings towards the water. Our door is on the left. If you get lost, please call Judy at [masked]

**About the Appsterdam Family Weekends:**

Appsterdam Family Weekends are a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his [blog](http://mur.mu.rs/?p=239): "Getting to know each other’s families will help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community."

Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more.

We hope to see you soon!
