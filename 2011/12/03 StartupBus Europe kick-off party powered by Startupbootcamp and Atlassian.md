Appsterdam fully supports this initiative and is therefore partnering with StartupBus Europe, StartupBootcamp & Atlassian.

Before the StartupBus will start this journey, there will be a Kick-off Party. This Saturday December 3th, the StartupBus kick-off party will take place at Atlassian. If you're interested in meeting both 'buspreneurs' and an elite group of successful entrepreneurs, feel free to RSVP.

Party starts at 7pm until 10pm.

More info on the Startup Bus:

Starting in Amsterdam and ending at Paris in time for the LeWeb conference, StartupBus Europe will be an entrepreneurial competition like no other. Part-hackathon, part-road trip, participants will have 3 days to conceive, build and launch a startup while traveling 100km an hour across the continent before pitching to a panel of top industry figures at LeWeb.

Participants will have the opportunity to test their skills against Europeâ€™s best hackers (developers), hustlers (marketeers) and hipsters (designers) while competing for the title of European Champions. In addition to the community that is formed, participants will be exposed to leading tech operations in Europe.
