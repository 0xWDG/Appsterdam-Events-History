Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

On December 10 we will give a hands-on Windows Phone programming session at the great [Lev Caupas co-working space](http://www.levkaupas.com/join-the-collective/). The workshop is meant for people new to Windows Phone programming, or haven't really "flexed their muscles" with it yet. We'll teach you in the way developers learn best: First we make sure you have the basic concepts at your fingertips, then we throw you in the deep end of the pool! That means you'll team up, pick an idea and start building an app, learning with your team while being supported by the facilitators. And best of all, we'll round off the afternoon with pizza and beer.

And best of all, we'll round off the afternoon with pizza and beer.

Hosts and facilitators: Matthijs Hoekstra (Microsoft), and a collection of volunteer guides.

Agenda:

9:30 - Doors open, gather, coffee, environment check

10:00 - 12:00 - Getting started: Hands-on introduction to Windows Phone

12:00 - 17:00 - Lunch, "Hackathon" style guided learning with a team

17:00 - Pizza and beer!

This session is targeted at developers. No Windows Phone experience necessary, but you should be comfortable with C# (or at least not afraid of it). You will need to bring a laptop with the [Windows Phone SDK 7.1](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=27570) installed and ready - pay attention to the system requirements!  If you don't have a Windows PC, we will have a few loaner laptops so please let us know when you signup.

We ask a €20 registration fee (payable onsite) to cover expenses and food. Space is limited to 20 people, so please notify us if you need to cancel before the session.
