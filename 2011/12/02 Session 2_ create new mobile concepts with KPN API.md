This means that independent and small companies like yours are able to implement functionality like Mobile Payments, SMS, Location Based Services using the mobile network, etc

Â 

The most important goal of this meeting is to let the answers of the following questions become almost equal:

-Which API's does the developer want/need?

-Which API's can KPN provide?

Workshop KPN likes to implement the API proposition as good as possible to your demands. Therefore, KPN asked SPING (known from Appsterdam Delft Hangout and recent Meet-the-Makers) to advise on the needs from the development community. In order to become acquainted with your technical, functional and business needs and requirements, Sping and creative partner Creatieve Koppen will organize **2 creative sessions**.

During the creative sessions we will brainstorm and discuss the types of APIâ€™s to be offered, possible combination of services, come up with new mobile concepts and business models.

So, are you an App-developer or are you advising companies what apps could mean for their business? Do you see the potential of KPN APIâ€™s and do you want to participate in this project? Itâ€™s a unique chance to influence the choices that are made, get in touch with KPN decisionmakers and a great opportunity to create new business and mobile concepts.

You can meet up for one of the two sessions:

-First session is November 23 from 1:00pm - 6:00pm.

-Second one is December 2nd from 1:00pm - 6:00pm

Â 

Hope to see you there!
