Join us on August 28 at De Hortus Botanicus for a casual meetup with live music from the Latin jazz trio, Toetoet. We'll meet at the front of De Hortus at 15.00 and the performance will start at 16.00. No worries about possible rain because the performance will be indoors! There is a restaurant/cafe there, but please feel free to bring snacks and beverages. The price is €7,50 for adults and €3,50 for children up to 14 years old.

Hope to see you all on Sunday!
