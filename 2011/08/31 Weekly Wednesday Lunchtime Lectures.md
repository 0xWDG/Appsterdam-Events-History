Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.

Â 

Due to health related problems, our speaker for today, Ciara Byrne, had to be rescheduled to september 21st. We wish her all the best and to recover soon.

In place of the previous lecture, our mayor of Appsterdam Mike Lee, will give a lecture titled **"So, you have an idea..."**
