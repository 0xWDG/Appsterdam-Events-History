Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

Â 

This week Matteo Manferdini will talk about "Writing readable code".

Readable and clean code is strategic in app development, making apps easier to change and adapt to a fast evolving market. Badly written code can impose a high tax on app makers, creating hard to find bugs and making the adding of features a hard and complex task.
