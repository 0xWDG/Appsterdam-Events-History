‘Meet the makers’ is a recurring event where passionate mobile enthusiasts show their creations and tell the stories behind them.

IceMobile loves the Appsterdam philosophy. In this first session, IceMobile will share the ins and outs of one of its recent projects: ABN AMRO Mobile Banking.

More than 80 dedicated Appsterdammers at IceMobile work to realise mobile concepts. The team faces challenges on a daily basis, trying to deliver the best user experience. While working on the ABN AMRO Mobile Banking project, IceMobile encountered some of its biggest challenges. During ‘Meet the Makers’ IceMobile's team will share learnings and insights (regarding information that is allowed to be shared). Various team members, involved in project management, concept, interaction design, visual design and development will take part in the presentation, giving their specific views within the project.
