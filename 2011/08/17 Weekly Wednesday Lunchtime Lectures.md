Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we can eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.

This weekÂ Gert Jan Spriesma from Distimo will talk about: **Four major market shifts. What does this mean for you?**

The lecture will focus on the following topics:

- How to monetize

- What stores to be in

- What countries to focus on

- Distribution beyond phones
