Founder of a startup?

Let's meet for a drink, quarterly every 1st Friday.

Exchange experiences, tips and tricks, relax a bit.

Come together and mingle.

Come alone and come in splendour.

We're happy to welcome you and introduce you to whom we know. You'll recognize one of us wearing a white jacket.

We would like to keep it select and relaxed.
