For those of you who haven’t heard the term ‘Deepfakes’, they are video manipulations that can make people say or do seemingly strange things.

Whether its Nicolas Cage playing Louis Lane in Superman, or Steve Buscemi superimposed over Jennifer Lawrence’s body, with today’s apps we can instantly create photo realistic 3D avatar from a simple photo.

We’ll start this special Appsterdam Business Chat by getting more familiar with 3D Realistic Avatars by downloading and trying out the Pinscreen App.

Later in the lunch we’ll discuss and debate what all these photo realistic Avatars and #Deepfakes mean to you, your company, our society (or even our democracy!)

As Jordan Peele demonstrates playing Barack Obama: “Stay Woke Bitches”!
