Today, **Kelly Walker** will join us from San Mateo, California. She is a Product Manager at Saygent, a tech start-up in the Valley. Kelly will share her **experiences at Saygent** during its short and hectic, but fascinating historyÂ so far:

"Saygent began as a subjective voice analysis system used for customer feedback by large companies. Today, we have pivoted to create a social network for indie comedians. In this talk, I will discuss the history of our company, how we came upon this most recent pivot, and what a major pivot means to me as an employee".

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
