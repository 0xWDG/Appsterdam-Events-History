Relax with us this Saturday on a guided tour of the [Hermitage Amsterdam](http://hermitage.nl), the largest branch of the Russian Hermitage Museum. We will first meet in the museum cafe for lunch/snacks (pay your own). Then, an experienced museum guide will give us a tour for an hour. Afterwards, feel free to explore the museum on your own. At 16:00, we will gather at the museum entrance and head to Rembrandtplein for drinks.

**About Appsterdam Weekend Fun:**

Appsterdam Weekend Fun is a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his blog: "Getting to know each other’s families will help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community." Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more. We hope to see you soon!
