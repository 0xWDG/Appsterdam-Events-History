This weekÂ **Eugene Borukhovich** will presentÂ **Open Health Data: Potential for Disruption**. He will give a brief overview of initiatives around the world and contrast this to what is happening in the Netherlands.

This lecture is part of the ongoing Open Data Initiative. Appsterdam is participating in a joint venture with Amsterdam Economic Board and Waag Society to leverage the open data dialogue and support developers and products that are using and/or combining open data meaningfully.

You are welcome to participate in the discussion, support and expand the open data network, co-create the tools and frameworks, and share open data knowledge and expertise. We want to hear your story and learn from your experience.E-mail us at [masked]

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
