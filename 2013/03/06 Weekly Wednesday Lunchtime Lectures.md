This week's lunch lecture will be presented by **Mirjam Luijten: The rise and shine of business-to-business apps.**

That we are app minded at Appsterdam is clear! However, a topic which we do not yet regularly discuss within the Appsterdam community is B2B apps - apps made to improve internal company processes.

In the presentation on March 6 we will discuss why B2B apps are so interesting, and which opportunities there are in the B2B app field.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
