---

For our first meeting, we will pedal from Amsterdam to Halfweg (roughly 14km), stop for a drink, then pedal back. We will increase the distance for future meetings

Â 

This event is strictly BYOB Â (Bring your own bike) You will also want to bring water and rain gear in case it starts raining (which it probably will, because this is Holland) We won't go super-fast for our first meeting, but we do need to get there and back in a day. You will also want to make sure you are visible with necessary lights and such in case the day is especially foggy or we end up riding in the dark. This event is free to attend, but bring some money for when we get to Halfweg and stop for a drink/snack.

Â 

If you have problems and are unable to attend, please contact Samuel at [masked] so we're not waiting for you.
