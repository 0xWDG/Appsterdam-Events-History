This week **Matteo Manferdini** will speak about **educational video games.**

Technology is more and more used for education, and software is playing a big part in it. Many type of educational apps are being written and one big part of them is composed by educational video games.Â Many of these games, though, address the problem in the wrong way, trying to sugarcoat educational material with a game around it.

We will see why education is especially fit to be transformed into video games and what is the correct way to make a game that is both fun and educational.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
