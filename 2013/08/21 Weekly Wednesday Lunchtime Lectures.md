This week, Tara Ross will present **Beware the Positive Feedback,** a case study on the Lean Startup customer discovery phase.

She will talk about her recent experience building and beta-testing a second-screen app MVP (minimum viable product), including tips for how to design and interpret tests for your riskiest product assumptions.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
