Come over to our new HQ and help us warm the house!Â 

We're excited to have a place of our very own at [A Lab](http://www.a-lab.nl/), where Appsterdammers can [work for free](https://github.com/Appsterdam/open/blob/master/resources/FreeWorkspace.md)<a href="https://github.com/Appsterdam/open/edit/master/resources/FreeWorkspace.md">&lt;/a&gt;, and where we will hold most of our events.Â 

Join us for an evening of food, drinks, and a tour of the facilities. We will also visit our neighbors, &lt;a href="http://www.protospace.nl/protospace-aan-het-ij"&gt;Protospace</a>--A Lab's in-house fablab--who will demonstrate some of the equipment they have available. AND we'll take you for a tour around the building!

A â‚¬5 donation is appreciated. Payable now through PayPal or at the event in cash. Donate â‚¬20 or more and receive an Appsterdam shirt!
