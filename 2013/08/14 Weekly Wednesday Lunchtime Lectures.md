This week we have **Marion de Groot**, who will speak about **Agile Functional Design**.

Agile is in fashion and Scrum is the way to go. "No more of those boring, endless specifications!" It sounds very appealing, but getting rid of all form of documentation is a bit too radical.

Functional Design is about what the software does, as opposed to what it looks like or how it's built. The importance of functional design is often overlooked, especially in Agile projects. Functional design is often linked to old-fashioned 'Waterfall' projects and large documents.

This presentation briefly explains the concepts of Functional Design, Waterfall and Agile for those who are not familiar with them. It explains the importance of 'thinking before doing' and how Functional Design can be done in an Agile way, and implemented in Scrum projects. This can be interesting for anyone remotely or closely involved in software development projects, with or without Scrum.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
