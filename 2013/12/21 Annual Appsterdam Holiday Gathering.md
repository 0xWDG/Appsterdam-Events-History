Woohoo, it's that time of year again! Let's get together for a night filled with fun, gifts, good company, food, drinks and of course "gezelligheid"! The two main things we'll do, is have a Potluck Dinner and a White Elephant Gift Exchange.

**Potluck Dinner**:

Everyone brings something to eat or drink to share. It doesn't matter if it's homemade or store bought.To make sure we'll end up with a good balance, we'll assign everyone with a category. After the RSVP is closed, we'll send an e-mail to all attendees with details on this.

**White Elephant Gift Exchange**:

The one tradition of the Appsterdam Holiday Gathering, is our own way of doing a White Elephant Gift Exchange. Everyone needs to bring a gift, preferably without spending any money. Anything you have lying around the house and don't use, a gift you got from your aunt who has a different taste than you do, something you have made yourself... It can be something fun, something useful, anything, as long as it is wrapped as a gift. All gifts are stacked in the center and will be divided through a game where both luck and strategy are factors.

Usually afterwards we hang around a bit longer, maybe have a drink, share stories about our Holliday traditions and maybe even sing a few songs.

We hope to see you there!
