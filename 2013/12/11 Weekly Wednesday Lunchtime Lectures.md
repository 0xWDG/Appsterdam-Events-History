This week we have **Pini ReznikÂ **and **Marc Coleman** who will talk about**Â Docker and the Software Delivery Pipeline.**

So, what exactly is Docker?

Docker describes itself asÂ an open-source project to easily create lightweight, portable, self-sufficient containers from any application. The same container that a developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at scale, in production, on VM's, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, public clouds and more.

What this actually means is that environments are specifiable in a text file, which can be versioned, diffed, and simply edited. This may be the final piece of the configuration management puzzle.

This talk will include an introduction into Docker and demonstration of basic functionality of Docker including Android development environment running in a Docker container.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
