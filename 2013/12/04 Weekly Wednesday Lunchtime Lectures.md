This week we have **Valentina Rao**, who will talk about "Behavior change for applications and applications for behavior change: a look into persuasive design".Â 

This talk will be about persuasive design in mobile apps, when to use it, how to use it, and when is it used appropriately.Â 

Some applications are "evil by design", they oblige the user to go in a certain direction, like pages on which you have to accept the conditions in order to proceed - this is not persuasion.Â 

To make your application successful, design has rather to be seductive, but also to leave space to individual will and actions, and to recognize and validate the user.Â 

The above is important for every kind of application, and it becomes key when your application is about behavior change.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
