In this lecture, **Jan Van Hellemond** will tell us **What The Web Can Do For Your Apps:** an exploration of new and exciting web technologies.

"Browsers have come a long way. Things that used to be exclusively in the domain of native apps are becoming more and more common in open web applications. I will introduce and demonstrate some of these things, like the File API, 3D rendering and animation, WebGL, audio tricks using the Web Audio API, video tricks using getUserMedia, the very new Speech API, etc.

Also, as a bonus, I will bring 3 [Firefox OS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/) devices from our [Open Device Lab](http://opendevicelab.com/#%21odl=1074) for unchaperoned fondling."

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
