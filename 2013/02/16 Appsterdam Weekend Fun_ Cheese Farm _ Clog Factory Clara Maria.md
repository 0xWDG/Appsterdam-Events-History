This month we'll travel to Amstelveen together, to visit Clara Maria Cheese & Clog farm! We'll gather at Amsterdam Central Station in front of Starbucks in the main hall at 12:45. From there we'll take the metro and bus together. To travel with metro and bus, you need a charged ov-chipcard, if you don't have one yet or need help charging your card, please make sure to be on time so we can help you! Travel costs are +/- €7,50

We'll arrive at Clara Maria at 14:00 where we'll have coffee and tea with apple pie to recover from our trip. After that we'll get a demonstration on clog making and cheese making and afterwards we get taste some cheese! This is all included in the price!

At Clara Maria the processes of both making cheese and making clogs is still real craftsmanship. It's situated in a 160 year old farm just outside Amstelveen, the perfect setting to practice and demonstrate traditional Dutch craftsmanship! They transformed the old barn into a nostalgic souvenir- and gift shop. More info: &lt;a href="http://claramaria.nl"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

**About Appsterdam Weekend Fun:**

Appsterdam Weekend Fun is a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his blog: "Getting to know each other’s families will help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community." Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more. We hope to see you soon!
