In honor of [Amsterdam Startup Week](http://amsterdamstartupweek.nl/), we are changing the format of Pitch Club this month to a **PITCH CONTEST**, in collaboration with [Atlassian](http://www.atlassian.com/) and [SoftLayer](http://www.softlayer.com/).

10 people will give their best **90-second pitch** for their idea in front of judges, Mike Lee (Mayor of Appstedam) and Floris van Alkemade (Founder/Partner at Solid Ventures). There will be great prizes for the winners!

**We will start the evening with pizza and drinks, then the pitch contest, followed by drinks and socializing.**

And this month we are breaking the third rule of pitch club--if it's your first time, you *don't* have to speak. **Spectators are welcome!**

Please RSVP, and let us know when subscribing if you would like to pitch.

Doors open at 6:00pm.
