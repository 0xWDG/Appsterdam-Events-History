This week's lecture will be presented byÂ **Samantha Hosea,** with the topic **Agile UX Research: Lessons learnt from Minigolf.**

"By now, we have all heard of Agile Development. And most of us have heard about the UX side of things. The design world is exploring agile methods more and more. In this talk, I explore what happens if you put two awesome things together: Agile and UX research. And I uncover that learning from your users with qualitative research does NOT have to take a lot of time and cost a lot of money, while gaining insights that can make or break your App".

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
