This week's lunch lecture will be presented by **Paul Darcey** and **Eddy Oosterhuis**. Some weeks ago, they hosted an Appsterdam Guru session on "**Best Practises In App Marketing**." That event aimed to get the best out of our own community by collecting, discussing and reviewing the experiences with app marketing by members of Appsterdam themselves.

In this WWLL we will share with you what we learned at that session. The findings range from surprising and inspirational to slightly depressing or questionable, but they're all very interesting.

All-in-all, this WWLL should not be missed by anyone who is interested in developing, creating and launching apps, and who also want to earn real money by marketing and selling those apps!

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
