This week's lecture will be presented byÂ **Jeroen Mol**, who is one of the pioneers with Augmented Reality (AR).

Already in 2007 Jeroen showed AR to the Dutch audience and in 2008 presented the first AR magazine to the world. In 2009 they shifted to the web and started to develop for mobile usage. In 2011 they introduced their own AR engine that was based on Action Script against an unbeatable price range; free SDK a free (adware) and a paid license.Â With Action Script the engine supported Flash and AIR. With AIR Native Extensions the engine now also supports iOS, Android and Blackberry 10.Â 

Jeroen is going to tell and show the **doâ€™s and donâ€™ts of AR** and a new direction they take with mobile.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
