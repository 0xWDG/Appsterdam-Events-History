Be part of the Appsterdam delegation that is invited to join a Client & Partner¬†Sneak Preview at Startupbootcamp NFC, in particular to help two¬†of their startups.

Startupbootcamp NFC is an accelerator program for startups that focus on Near Field Communication and Wireless Interactions technology. 10 startups from 8 different countries were chosen after an intense selection period to participate.

These startups are now going through a three-month roller-coaster ride. They receive seed funding, get free office space in the middle of Amsterdam, they are provided with workshops, inspiration sessions and mentor sessions, and have access to the extensive network of Startupbootcamp.

On the 17th of January 2014 the 10 startups will pitch their company to 350 investors from all over the world at the Startupbootcamp NFC Demo Day. Check the video at the bottom¬†to get an idea of what that will be like!

Being part of the Appsterdam delegation allows you to connect to the 10 NFC & Contactless Interactions startups, to become a potential client or partner, or to improve their proposition in this program.¬†Especially two of these startups, **[Relayr](http://www.relayr.de/)**¬†and **[TapTrack](http://www.taptrack.com/),**¬†are reaching out to the developer community to test their business model assumptions. They want to examine their ideas with developers and assure¬†their idea is 'spot on ':

‚Ä¢¬†**Relayr** is working on the internet of things. Internet is the connection of virtual worlds, where the internet of things connects all sorts of hardware with all sorts of users.¬†

‚Ä¢¬†**TapTrak** is creating a platform to make the use of different NFC technologies¬†easy for app developers. Besides unprecedented dynamic capabilities with NFC chips, it will save much development time.¬†

During the Client & Partner Sneak Preview the startups will pitch their company and there will be a short Q&A after every pitch. You will have the possibility to talk to the startups and meet the co-founders of Startupbootcamp Amsterdam: Patrick de Zeeuw and Ruud Hendriks.

As a member of the Appsterdam delegation you can catch a glimpse of these 10 very innovative startups, see their products and get in touch with the enthusiastic and promising entrepreneurs.

When RSVPing you'll be asked to indicate in which of the teams you are interested. At the bottom of this invitation, you can find a brief introduction to these 10 startups. There is [an overview](http://www.startupbootcamp.org/programs/nfc-contactless.html) where you can find their elevator pitch video by clicking on the logo of the startup.

*NOTE: If we receive too many RSVPs, Startupbootcamp preserves the right to make a selection of based in the information you enter. People interested in Relayr and Taptrak will then have a preference.*
