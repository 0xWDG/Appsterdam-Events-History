**Human progress visualized!**

This week we will have **Marc Garrett** with [**Intridea**](http://intridea.com/).

People live longer, are better educated, lead more healthful lives, and are less violent than at any time in human history. Marc will explain:

‚Ä¢¬†How we saved hundreds of hours of effort by using R to build a ‚Äúcorrelation quilt‚Äù to help us uncover interesting stories in the data.

‚Ä¢¬†How we used a responsive design and D3.js to let people explore the data sets whether on desktop or mobile.

‚Ä¢¬†How we put Steven Pinker‚Äôs data from ‚Äú[The Better Angles of our Nature](http://www.amazon.com/The-Better-Angels-Our-Nature/dp/1455883115)‚Äù ('we may be living in the most peaceable era yet')¬†on the web for the first time ever.

Marc is a MITX award-winning solutions architect.

Prior to joining Intridea, Marc was Vice President of Interactive Development at Bridgeline Digital. Marc has developed web solutions for the National Children‚Äôs Museum, the Washington Redskins, Hooked on Phonics, and Congressional Quarterly.

The author and editor of numerous programming titles, Marc was also instrumental in architecting the Maine Learning Technology Initiative, a program that distributed Apple laptops to every seventh grade student in the state of Maine. Marc holds a Juris Doctor from American University, Washington College of Law, and a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in English from the University of Georgia. He has worked in New York, Washington DC, and Singapore.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
