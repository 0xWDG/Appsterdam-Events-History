This week we have Daria Koreniushkina, App Store Marketing Manager at SellanApp ([sellanapp.com](http://sellanapp.com))

"My lecture will be devoted to app marketing. I pursue the vision that app marketing is mostly oriented to managing expectations of a platform - an app store. For now, this is by far the most effective channel for marketing an app. In order to market your app successfully, you need to understand the platform as deep as you can. This lecture will hopefully give new insights into app store ecosystem.

For my Master thesis I looked at app stores as promotional platforms and their influence on marketing practices of app makers. During the lecture I will present the most interesting results of my research. I will share some valuable data showing the impact of getting featured on app downloads. We will also look at marketing cases of such apps as Foldify, Weathercube, Fietsfinder.

Finally, I will give practical recommendations on developing a strategy for the app launch as well as deploying such app marketing techniques as App Store Optimisation, localisation, getting user reviews, app advertising, getting reviewed by app-centric media."Â Â

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
