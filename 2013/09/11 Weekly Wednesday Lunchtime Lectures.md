This week we have **Marco van Heerde**, who will talk about **Behavior design, an emerging field driven by mobile technology**.Â 

How can we use technology to influence behavior and attitudes of people? We'll give an overview of this emerging field, the most exiting projects and dive into one of the scientific models underlying this field. Â

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
