Come join us for a "speurtocht" (scavenger hunt) at [A Lab](http://a-lab.nl/), the hot new tech and innovation hub in Amsterdam Noord--which is also our new HQ!Â 

This is a great opportunity to preview A Lab before its grand opening the following week.

Come see what **Appsterdam and other creative businesses and start-ups** are working on in the newly renovated Shell Labs building.

**Please bring your Android or iOS device.** We will use the [Xpose AR app](http://www.buzzar.net/)<a href="http://www.buzzar.net/">&lt;/a&gt; (one of our neighbors in A Lab) to guide you around the building.

This event is part of **Amsterdam Urban Innovation Week 2013:**

*What does it take to Redefine Growth on a scale that really matters? During the Amsterdam Urban Innovation Week 2013, we will try to answer this question. Together with more than 100 partners and initiatives in Amsterdam, we are challenging the different visions, beliefs, local experiences and concrete practices in the city to find new perspectives, models and ways to handle everyday life. The week is initiated by Pakhuis de Zwijger, PICNIC, Waag Society, Amsterdam Creative Industries Centre of Expertise, Amsterdam Smart City, Gemeente Amsterdam and the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, supported by Stimuleringsfonds voor de Creatieve Industrie.*
