This week we have **Paul Manwaring**, co-founder of our kind host Glimworm, who will talk about **Pubic-private collaboration on apps to distribute Cultural Heritage Digital Content**.

"I will go over lessons learned working with the Netherlands Beeld en Geluid Instituut for our Vistory App (Winner Apps for Netherlands 2012); The Rijkmuseum for the Rijksmuseum Muse App and Europeana for the Europeana Open Culture App.  Specifically, I will focus on challenges using the (open) APIs; licensing complications; risks relating to terms and conditions; best management practices; value propostions and sustainable business models and opportunities".

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
