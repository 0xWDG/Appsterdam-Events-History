As some app makers are in trouble because of the incorrect BTW/VAT declarations, this is a significant topic for Appsterdammers.Â This lecture, we have Victor Alting van Geusau andÂ Wilbert Nieuwenhuizen, who will talk about the VAT flow of apps, including rules for "shifting" VAT and VAT declaration.

Victor Alting of Geusau wrote a thesis about the subject. Wilbert Nieuwenhuizen is an experienced tax expert.Â

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
