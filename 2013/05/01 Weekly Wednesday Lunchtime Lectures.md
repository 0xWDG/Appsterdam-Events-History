**Ronald Doodkorte** will talk during this week's lecture about beingÂ **Appsolutely Motivated.**

Building an app often starts with a personal dream and you are highly motivated to make it happen. You believe your idea is incredible and people can't wait to get their hands on it. However, very quickly you discover that one of the most critical challenges is to understand and adapt to your customers' needs. So you get out of the building, collect customer insights, and you pivot until you have found a proposition that stands out from the clutter.

During this talk I will share some thoughts and examples on why it is still important to stay close to your personal motivations, and how powerful it is to use these in turning your app into a success.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
