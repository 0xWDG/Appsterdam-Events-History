This week's lecture will feature **Giwan Persaud** and his co-founderÂ who will share their **lessons learnt with the startup Questonise** (@questionise).

"When building Questionise, an in-company productivity tool, we've made some mistakes. We would like to share the lessons learnt from a top 10 list of things that have gone wrong, or that in hindsight can be at least considered risky decisions.

We hope you will learn from our experiences and look forward to get some insights back from the community as well".

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
