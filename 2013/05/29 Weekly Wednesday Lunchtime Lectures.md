During this lecture, **Michael van den Berg** from **Appsolute Value** will take you down to big corporate app life, where the grass is green and the apps are pretty..

Michael will share his experience from working with large corporates

and how they deal with app making.. and more! Large companies are moving now on to a multi-app business environment and bypass the HTML 5 and native SDK 'battle'. More and more they tend to use cross-platform app development solutions. Michael will show why and how these companies move towards these frameworks on a global scale.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
