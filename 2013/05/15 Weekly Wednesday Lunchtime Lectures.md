In this week's lecture,Â **Amir Ben-Sheffer** will share his experience developing **Vowch â€“ a hot new social network app** out of NYC.

While working with outsourced development shops and in-house engineers, Amir was surprised time and again to see that some companies and individuals out there do not implement some standards that should be obvious nowadays.

In the meetup, Amir will share some of the best practices he collected while developing Vowch and create the Appsterdam open source best practices document. The lecture will be mostly technical, spanning the entire client server architecture and some product design issues.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
