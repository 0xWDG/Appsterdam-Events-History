This week,Â Steffen Hedebrandt will talk about **Running a Start-Up in the Human Cloud--Boostrapping with Online Freelancers**.

Every day successful apps are built on Elance. In this presentation, you will get a taste of what the humanÂ cloud is, how you can take advantage of it when building and running your startup, which jobs and roles you can source for and work with online and what the benefits are.Â Steffen will draw on his own experiences and present some examples of virtual and hybrid organizations to show you how easily you can get started within the human cloud and execute eg. App building projects.

Steffen Hedebrandt is Client Marketing Manager for Elance.com. He will also be joining us for the [Meeten en Drinken](http://meetup.appsterdam.rs/events/87026822/) event at Cafe Bax later at 19:00hr to keep the conversation going. We hope you'll join us!

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
