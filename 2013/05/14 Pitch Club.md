"The first rule of Pitch Club is talk about Pitch Club.

The second rule of Pitch Club is, seriously, talk about Pitch Club.

The third rule of Pitch Club is, if this is your first time, you have to speak."

Following the format of "The Most Important Minute of Your Life" concept by Appsterdam Mayor Mike Lee, participants will give a **60-second elevator pitch** of their business, product, or life mission.

Mike will then give personalized, honest feedback to each speaker to help hone your message.

Â 

Â 

Pitch Club will happen monthly every 2nd Tuesday.
