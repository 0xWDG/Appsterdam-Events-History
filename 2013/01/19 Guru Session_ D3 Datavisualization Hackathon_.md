Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

The [D3 Javascript Library](http://d3js.org/) is used for building data driven documents and visualizations, but the learning curve is pretty steep. This session will be a shared learning experience: Vincent D. Warmerdam will provide some data and challenges, attendees will break up into teams and tackle them with D3. At points during the day you'll share lessons, and at the end show off your great results!

Agenda:

10:00-10:30: Doors open, participants sign in

10:30-11:30: Short D3 introduction, sample data set (hint: we will try to conquer the world with this dataset) 

11:30: Break into teams and get to work!

19:00-20:00: Final presentations and sharing

This session is meant for a technical audience, dataminers and developers. Dataviz people and designers are welcome too, but keep in mind everyone will be exploring a new library so you shouldn't be afraid to jump into the Javascript and you should be familiar with code.

If you are a javascript expert and if you have familiarity with (google) maps, know that you are VERY welcome to join the fun.  If you want to prepare for the session you may to try this first tutorial: [http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/](http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/)

(You can also bring your own datasets and challenges to tackle)
