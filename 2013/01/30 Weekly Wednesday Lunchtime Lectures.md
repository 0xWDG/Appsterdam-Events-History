**'Welcome back, Mayor!'**

This week's lecture will be presented by **Mike Lee** ([@bmf](http://twitter.com/bmf)).

Sometime in the middle of last year, our esteemed founder, the Mayor of Appsterdam, stepped down as CEO and lead a team of App Makers into the frontier at the edge of reality where the future is brought and technology is born.

He's since re-emerged from that place, in a state familiar to most of us, half-mad and in need of a bath. We've cleaned him up and will set him down to answer some questions.

Where did you go? What did you see? What did you learn? What did you bring back? Where do we go from here? We'll talk about the futureâ€”not in some grand sense, but at the day-to-day street-level of workers in the future-bringing industry. We'll talk about the New Lemurs, and the quest to make a new kind of game to teach a new kind of science. We'll talk about the importance of staying uncomfortable, challenging yourself to see and do things differently. We'll talk about what to do when you're an App Maker who is independent in spirit, but not in finances, in an App Universe where the white-hot expansion is over. We'll talk about structuring our businesses without being able to rely on explosive growth, in an indifferent market. Can we change our relationship with failure? Finally we'll talk about Appsterdam, what it has been, and what it should become. What does it mean to us? What is it worth to us?

Don't miss this intimate Town Hall style lecture with the one and only Mike Lee.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
