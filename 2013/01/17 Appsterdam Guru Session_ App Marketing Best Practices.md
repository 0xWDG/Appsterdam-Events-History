In this Guru Session, we will be our own Gurus!

This afternoon event aims to get the best out of the Appsterdam community. We would like to get at best practices for successful app marketing by collecting, discussing and reviewing the experiences of members of our own community. Ultimately we would like to select critical success factors for successfully marketing your own app today.

Topics will be:

• Appstore submission (timing, keywords, getting highlighted, alternative stores etc.)

• Publicity (free press, reviews, social media, own website etc.)

• Pricing models (free/paid, lite/pro/fremium, free promotions, ads etc.)

• Other (international launches, US/rest of world, local languages etc.)

Agenda:

12:00-13:00: Doors open

13:00-17:00: Session starts

17:00-18:30: Pizza/beer

Because of the nature of this discussion, **we would like to only invite members who have launched their own app** so we can share real-life experiences about the above topics. For anyone else interested: **we will share the outcome of the discussion afterwards in a Wednesday Lunch Lecture** so everyone can benefit from it!

Before the event we will send all participants a short e-mail in which we will ask you a few short questions about your app(s) in order to be well prepared and get the most out of the session.

Your moderator and host for the day will be Paul Darcey and Eddy Oosterhuis.
