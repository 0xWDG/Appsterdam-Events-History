The Monthly Speaker Training meeting is an opportunity to practice public speaking and sharpen your skills. Participants will give a short speech and then receive feedback.

Every attendee will be expected to give a speech—no spectators, please. Speeches can cover any topic and will be limited to 10 minutes. Please come with a speech already prepared. Slides are recommended. All levels are welcome, from beginner to advanced.

Before the meeting, we recommend you watch a video about presenting by Appsterdam Mayor, Mike Lee. [http://youtu.be/6Jidkf7RggU](http://youtu.be/6Jidkf7RggU)

We’re limited to 5 people maximum per meeting, so please RSVP if you would like to come. The training will be held every last Monday of the month, so you can RSVP for a future meeting if this one is full.

Most importantly, the goal is to help you improve. Therefore you will be receiving some constructive feedback on your presentation, so please come with an open and receptive mind.

Looking forward to seeing you there!
