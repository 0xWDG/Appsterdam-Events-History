[Mattt Thompson](http://twitter.com/mattt) is visiting Appsterdam this week and he's giving you the opportunity to ask him anything! Well, almost anything. Today's event is much like our weekly Peer Lab. We encourage you to bring your laptop and technical questions so that Mattt can answer them.

This is your chance to talk to Mattt about his favorite topics:

- AFNetworking (2.0, especially), and iOS 7 Networking

- NSHipster

- API design

- Web Application Development with Ruby

- Heroku

- PostgreSQL

Drinks and light snacks will be served. A â‚¬2-5 donation is appreciated, payable in cash at the event.

We're also hosting the fourth NSHipster Pub Quiz on Tuesday evening, so [be sure to RSVP](http://www.meetup.com/Appsterdam/events/143596702/) for that. It's going to be great fun!
