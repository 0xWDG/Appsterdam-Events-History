This weekÂ **Eugen Martynov** will tell us **how to unit test Android applications with Robolectric.Â 

**

Unfortunately, unit testing for mobile is cumbersome: hard to start, maintain and generally not very enjoyable. The usual recipes are tests on simulators, partial tests or even hardcore mocking.Â 

In this lecture, Eugen will teach us how to use Robolectric to write Android desktop tests in order to get faster feedback and clean test code.Â We will get acquainted with Robolectric and RoboGuice 2.0, and in addition Eugen will share his personal thoughts on the topic.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
