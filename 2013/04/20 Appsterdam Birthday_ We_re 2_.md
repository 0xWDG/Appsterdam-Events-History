Appsterdam is turning 2 years old on April 20th! Join us in the city where it all began as we look back on where we’ve come from, what we’ve accomplished, and where we’re going. Get to know the people behind the movement and wish them a warm “Gefeliciteerd!”

As a 100% volunteer-driven, non-profit organization, we’ve spent these past two years giving to the community. Help us sustain the organization by attending this event and participating in our fundraising efforts.

We’ve got a really fun weekend planned for you! Explore Amsterdam with these day tours: [bike tour](http://meetup.appsterdam.rs/events/112429272/), [Tuschinski tour](http://meetup.appsterdam.rs/events/114154422/), [DIY GPS tour](http://meetup.appsterdam.rs/events/113627222/), or [Waag & FabLab tour](http://meetup.appsterdam.rs/events/114764322/). There will be a casual pre-party gathering at Nieuwmarkt around 16:00. Then in the evening, put your dancing shoes on and party with us in a 17th century church. We’ll have tapas, an open bar, lightning talks, an [App Wall](http://www.facebook.com/Appsterdam/posts/451917004887282), and live music to entertain you all night.

On Sunday, we'll have the [volunteer appreciation "hangover" brunch](http://meetup.appsterdam.rs/events/109248592/) to thank all the wonderful volunteers who have worked so hard to keep Appsterdam going. This is your chance to send off your fellow Appsterdammers from abroad with a delicious "bon voyage!"

While the [grachtengordel](http://youtu.be/S4mfCAnp-Ek) ('canalbelt' for you non-Dutchies) is celebrating 400 years of beautifying the city, we’re celebrating 2 years of empowering the app ecosystem. What better time, what better opportunity, for us to come together as colleagues, to remember, to reveal and to reflect? What better time to decide once and for all what Appsterdam is, what Appsterdam means to us, and what Appsterdam will be—in what we hope will be a long and prosperous future.
