**Brainstorm and hack on software for developing Open Hardware!**

The way people develop new products is changing. The maker movement is dubbed 'the new industrial revolution.'

Join people from FabLabs, hackerspaces, Open Hardware companies and software developers to brainstorm and hack on applications that make collaborating on hardware easier.

The Amsterdam Jam coincides with the OH Doc Jam in New York. We will also bring the results of this Jam to the Ouisharefest in Paris.

Â 

The Jam is co-organized with Wevolver.

Wevolver is developing an open source application for makers and creatives to share their work in progress, so they can connect and collaborate with others.

You don't need to have coding skills to join, al input is welcome.

Do you feel you have experience in the field? Do you have ideas on how online collaboration on physical products should work?Â Do you want to prototype solutions for online collaboration?Do you want to have fun?

Join us on our quest to provide hardware a place to create and innovate!
