Tours *(the actual tour files will be uploaded soon!)*:

- **Long sight-seeing tour**:

Discover both the famous tourist attractions in the city center, as well as the hidden treasures in a 4,5km long walk.

- **Short sight-seeing tour**:

Discover the favorite highlights of downtown Amsterdam in this 3km walk!

- **Surprise puzzle tour**:

Walk criss-cross around the city, and answer a question at 10 different locations to create a 10-letter Dutch word. Bring your answer to the party (on the printed sheet), and if you solved the puzzle correctly, you win a free Appsterdam T-shirt!

**Printed copies of the tour routes will be available at Bouncespace, aka "Appsterdam Centraal," located at the old Booking.com building on Weteringschans 28.*

The starting time is, of course, just an indicator. If you print out the tour route yourself, you can start any time you like! Several other tours are happening at the same time, all tours finish at Nieuwmarkt around 16:00
