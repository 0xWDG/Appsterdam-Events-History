Originally this meetup was planned on the Sunday 21, 10:15, but had to be rescheduled.

So, on April 20, as a prelude to our [party](http://meetup.appsterdam.rs/events/103837002/), we'll have a tour at the Tuschinsky Movie Theater. Beware, this may very well be one of the last opportunities you get to see it in this way, as PathÃ© is considering to organize it differently.

Tuschinsky opened their doors onÂ October 28, 1921. It was the most luxurious cinema known in the Netherlands. On deep pile carpets, the visitor walked into richly decorated fairytale world.

That is what Tuschinski is about.
