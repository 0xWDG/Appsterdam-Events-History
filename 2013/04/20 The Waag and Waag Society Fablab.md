Appsterdam cooperates with [Waag Society](http://waag.org/) in various ways. While you are in town to for our birthday, here's your chance to find why and what Waag Society can do for you.

You will also get a tour through [this historical building](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waag_(Amsterdam)), where in the early days public authopsies were performed on criminals, just executed on the square in front!

Free tour, but we need 10 people to let it go through. [which is done!]

**13:45** Doors open

**14:00** Start presentation and Tour.

**15:30** Estimated end

Waag Society is an institute for art, science and technology and develops creative technology for social innovation.

Waag Society follows the method of Creative Research. Creative Research is experimental, interdisciplinary research. Artists, creatives and end users have a central position: Users as Designers. Creative Research is related to participatory design, rapid prototyping, practice based research and tinkering. Waag Society has a strong focus to let user groups participate in internet, new media and technology that otherwise have limited access.

Waag Society hosts [Fablab](http://waag.org/en/service/fablab-amsterdam) Amsterdam, where anyone can realize their ideas, with the aid of digital equipment transforming those ideas into prototypes and products. Fablab Amsterdam is situated at the [Waag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waag_(Amsterdam)) in Amsterdam.

The Fablab was developed by [Neil Gershenfeld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gershenfeld) from MIT during a class 'How to make almost anything'. It stands for Fabrication Laboratory. Fablab has developed into a global network of standardized open hardware setups.

Waag Society offers workshop formats for technical education, but also uses the Fablab as a rapid prototyping facility for projects. The Fablabs around the world are connected to each other by using an advanced video conferencing system forÂ sharing knowledge and ideas. Fablab Amsterdam is open two days a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays) for the general public to come in and realize their own ideas (on appointment). But come prepared: get your ideas and designs on paper or on the computer before visiting Fablab!
