This lecture featuresÂ **Rajen Kishna** from Microsoft, whoÂ will tell us more about **Windows Phone development.**

In October of 2012, Microsoft launched the first major update to its Windows Phone operating system along with the latest major Windows release. The Windows Phone 8 release brings a number of fundamental changes to the operating system and a lot of new opportunities for developers to create new app experiences. In this session weâ€™ll explore the new features through demos to give you a great understanding of the platform, whether youâ€™re a new or an established Windows Phone developer. As an added bonus, weâ€™ll look how Windows 8 and Windows Phone work together to offer developers amazing reach with their apps.

Key takeaways:

- Windows Phone 8 platform changes

- Windows Phone developer opportunities

- Cross platform opportunities with Windows 8 and Windows Phone

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
