Visiting Amsterdam for the [Birthday Party](http://meetup.appsterdam.rs/events/103837002/)? Do you already live here and just want to see more of the city?

We will meet at 13:00 and ride around the city, appreciating the beautiful architecture and scenic, 400-year-old canals. We will stop halfway at a cafe to refuel and then continue on until about 16:00. We will not be riding fast, so any bike will work fine for the trip. Come see the sights via one of the best ways there is: by bike!
