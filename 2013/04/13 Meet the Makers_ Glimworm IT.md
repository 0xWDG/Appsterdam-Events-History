â€˜Meet the Makersâ€™ is a recurring event where distinguished tech companies show their creations and share the stories behind them.

[Glimworm I](http://www.glimworm.com/)[T](http://www.glimworm.com/) loves the Appsterdam philosophy. The co-founder,Â Jonathan Carter, has nearly 30 years in web development. His list of accomplishments includes everything from project management to robot building, and he continues to keep on top of new developments by constantly evaluating emergingÂ technologies.

In this session, he will share the ins and outs of the [ParkShark Amsterdam App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/park-shark-amsterdam/id510032256?l=nl&ls=1&mt=8), and developers will have the chance to learn how to use the [ParkShark API](http://api.parkshark.nl/), the first award winner in the Apps for Amsterdam competition.Â Jonathan will also tell more about the [ParkShark City Platform](http://www.parkshark.eu/), which connects Cities, Developers and Citizens.

The event is part of the Apps for Amsterdam: Open for Business program. A joint venture to leverage the open data dialogue and support developers and products that are using and/or combining open data meaningfully.Â We want toÂ hear your story and learn from your experience.Â E-mail us atÂ [[masked]](mailto:[masked])
