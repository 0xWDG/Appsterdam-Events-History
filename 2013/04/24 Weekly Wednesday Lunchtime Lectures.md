In this lectureÂ **Rik van Bruggen** will tell us more aboutÂ **Using Graph Databases for App Development.**

With Facebook's announcement of their "graph search" capabilities and a lot of people facing the limits of traditional database systems, a new category of databases is emerging in the NOSQL landscape that allows for much more powerful queries - whether it be in social networking applications, recommendation engines or advanced analytics. During this talk, we will give you a high level overview of the technology, as well as some practical examples and demonstrations to give you "food for thought".

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
