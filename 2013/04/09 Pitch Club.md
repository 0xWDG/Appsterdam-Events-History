"The first rule of Pitch Club is talk about Pitch Club.

The second rule of Pitch Club is, seriously, talk about Pitch Club.

The third rule of Pitch Club is, if this is your first time, you have to speak."

Following the format of "The Most Important Minute of Your Life" concept by Appsterdam Mayor Mike Lee, participants will give a **60-second elevator pitch** of their business, product, or life mission.

Mike will then give personalized, honest feedback to each speaker to help hone your message.

THIS MONTH we will also see pitches about open data projects from the three "Apps4Appsterdam Open For Business" teams. Open For Business is a joint initiative with Appsterdam, the Amsterdam Economic Board, and The Waag Society toÂ to work with three localÂ start-upsÂ to support them in making successful businesses using open data.

Pitch Club will happen monthly every 2nd Tuesday.
