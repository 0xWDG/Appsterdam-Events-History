This week, **Robert Atkins** will speak about **Ill Communication.**

Programmers are good at communicating their intent to the computer, they're good at testing to see if they were understood and they're good at debugging when it all goes wrong.

Often overlooked is the communication between the programmer and the rest of the team, but this is even more importantâ€”more projects fail for building the wrong thing perfectly than building the right thing poorly.

Robert shares some warning signs of Ill Communication and some techniques you can use to 'debug' it.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
