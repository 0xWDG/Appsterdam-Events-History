This week, we have **Berend**, **Geoffrey** and **Thijs** from **Bird&Bird** (international law)Â talking about **Boring Legal Stuff**.

Developers are usually not too fond of the legal side of things. Understandable: they want to focus on creating beautiful applications, and not on the boring legal stuff. Nonetheless, when the proverbial sh*t hits the fan or when the time is there to sell your software or company, the value of this boring legal stuff becomes apparent.

In a one-hour lunch session, Thijs, Geoffrey and Berend will highlight some considerations for developers and entrepreneurs. What legal entity should I choose? How do I best protect my creations? Should I have terms & conditions? What about privacy?

The speakers invite all attendees to participate and let them know up front what they would like to get from this session via:

**Thijs van den Heuvel @TMVDH**

**Geoffrey Beurskens [masked]**

**Berend van der Eijk @berendvdeijk**

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
