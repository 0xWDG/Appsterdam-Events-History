This time we'll be traveling down to the Hague to seeÂ Tour de Frans Alleycat race!

We will meet in the Hague at 15:00 at Binckhorstlaan 36. Once the race starts, we can cruise around the city and head to the finish line.

You can take your bike on the train, so come on down!

I will be riding there from Amsterdam by bike if you would like to join. I'll be pushing as fast as I can (25-35km/hour roughly). According to Google Maps, this is a 61km trip. If you would like to join me, send me an email so I know you're coming.

See you in the Hague!
