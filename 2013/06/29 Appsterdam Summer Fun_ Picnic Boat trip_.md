Summer appears to be finally among us! Let's have a picnic! Let's have a boat trip! Wait, let's have a picnic on a boat!

Rudolf Jurgens* will be our Captain of the day. He provides the boat, with a fridge and music on board! What do you bring? Some food and drinks to share, that's all! (And keep your fingers crossed for perfect weather in the meantime)

Because we have a limited number of attendees for this event, please be so kind to change your status if it turns outÂ you're not able to join.

We'll gather at the Haarlemmermeerstation at 2:15 PM and walk towards the boat from there.
