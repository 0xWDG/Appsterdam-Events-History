In this lecture we have **Saul Mora** over from the US, who will share his experiences **teaching kids to program** in the classroom.

Kids these days donâ€™t know how good they have it! But, sadly, unless we teach them about the technology theyâ€™re growing up with, they will never know. Teaching kids to program will become as fundamental as reading, writing and arithmetic. Having taught not only my own kids, but their classmates at their elementary school, I have a few words of advice to share about techniques, what to expect and just how fun and rewarding it can be to teach kids to program!

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
