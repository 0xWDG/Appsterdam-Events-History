This week's lunch lecture features **Samantha Hosea**. We will explore how we can design and build a product that both fits your users' worlds and goes in the direction you want it to go.

The trick is to listen to your users (by applying Situational Thinking) and to listen to your own gut feeling and ideas (Product Vision), while also taking little steps and adapting along the way (Agile & Lean approaches).

Well-designed applications have a good balance between these all these things.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
