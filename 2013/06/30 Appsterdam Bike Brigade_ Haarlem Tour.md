We're going to meet up and go for a ride!

- This ride is strictly BYOB (Bring Your Own Bike). You will also want to bring water and clothes to handle the weather.

- If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

- No specific kind of bike is required. Ideally it's a bike you like that fits you properly. We can help with adjustments if you need help making it fit.

- It's totally fine if you can't come to every one of these rides. Come to the ones you can and we'll be happy to have you.

Â 

This week we will ride to Haarlem where our ownÂ John Giusto will meet us for a little tour of the area and a BBQ hosted by Tara and John. Make sure you RSVP if you're coming so they know how many people to prepare for!
