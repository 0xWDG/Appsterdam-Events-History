This week's lecture is presented by **Mirjam Luijten** from PINCH, who recently launched PocketShop and Kado to go.

Pocketshop is a low-key shop app framework that enables everyone to open their own shop app. Kado to go is the first mobile only store in the Netherlands and launched with this framework.

During the presentation Mirjam will update us on the latest facts on **mobile commerce** and share her **experiences with** the launch of their shop app **Kado to go**.

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
