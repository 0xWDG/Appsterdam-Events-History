This week we haveÂ **Bas van den Heuvel** from Proxible, who will talk aboutÂ **the future of sharing relevant information actively, using sensor techniques and apps.**

"People are curious by nature, they want to know more about things that are around them and whatâ€™s happening around them. I will explain how most apps that provide this kind of info are evolving from just sharing information to sharing hyper local information using active sensors and eventually m2m information sharing.Â I also will explain on how people will benefit from this in the very near future."

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
