Appsterdam has a new HQ at [A Lab](http://a-lab.nl)! This is our very own space that you can use to work in for free!

We aren't quite "open for business" yet, but feel free to come in tomorrow from 10:00-17:00. Bring your laptop and see the place to be for all App Makers! Free coffee and wifi.

Last year we had a temporary spot just like it at Westergasfabriek, and now we have a new one located just across the IJ in the old Shell Lab buildings.

Check out the [panorama pic](http://360.io/SCRLA4) of our room!

**Getting There**

Take the free ferry from Centraal Station to Buiksloterweg, which comes every 5 minutes. As you're looking north from the ferry, you'll see a large red brick building that says "A Lab" (it's pretty hard to miss). From the ferry dock, head left towards the Eye Film Institute, cross the small bridge, then make an immediate right through the metal gate. When you enter A Lab, head right from the coffee lounge and our room is the first on the right--Workhotel.001!
