On Wednesday the 24th at 16:00 - 18:00 there is a meeting at Glimworm HQ with the Project Manager working on the Dutch Government's project to implement open parking data. The goal of this meeting is for Stefan Eisses of Rapp Trans (NL) b.v. who is working directly for the government minister to get a developers viewpoint from Appsterdam members.

The meeting has been arranged by Glimworm and a core set of people who worked on the DIVV multi modal api report are already invited.

Anyone from Appsterdam is welcome to join and be part of the process. Upon RSVP-ing you'll be prompted forÂ brief sentence on involvement and interest in open data and / or mobility as we may have to limit the group as time is tight.

Developer Wish List

I have already put the following items on the developer wish list:

1. The data should be available without a user account or complicated sign up

2. The data should be easily usable by developers i.e. json format, standard longitude,latitude etc..; and also include real time availability where is it not impossible.

3. There should be a contact person for the data to answer data related questions

4. The data should be useable in any way we like and we should be able to store it. Â For instance we should be able to collect data over time and make our own predictive models

5.We should be able to use the data to criticize the parking authorities if we want to.

6. Parking tariff information must not be fixed data as we already know that variable rate parking is here this year. (see : sf-park )

7. All necessary calculation formulas , for instance for day cards should be published.
