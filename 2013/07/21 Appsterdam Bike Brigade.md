We're going to meet up and go for a ride! Now is your chance to get out and see what this biking-for-fun thing is about or to come help new people get out and enjoy the all these bike lanes they built all over the country!

- This ride is strictly BYOB (Bring Your Own Bike). You will also want to bring water and clothes to handle the weather.

- How far we go will depend on who signs up, but we'll aim for at least 20km and a beer/coffee stop.

- If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

- It's totally fine if you can't come to every one of these rides. Come to the ones you can and we'll be happy to have you.
