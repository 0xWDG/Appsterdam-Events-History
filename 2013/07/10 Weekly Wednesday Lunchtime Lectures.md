This week's lecture will be presented by **Jeroen Bos** from PressDoc, who willÂ talk about the **PRÂ do's and don'ts for startups**.

"Most startups' time is dedicated to the development of their product and this way PR probably becomes an afterthought. I'll go through some good ol' PR do's and don'ts for the early stages of a product or service."

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
