In this lecture we have **Ohyoon Kwon, Giovanni Maggini and Piotr Steininger** from the [Code for Europe](http://codeforeurope.net/) project, who will share their experiences in building apps for three challenges in the City of Amsterdam.

How do you spread tourists in the city?

How do you manage offer/request of spaces from people in a neighbourhood that want to join or start activities?

How do you help a team of professionals working on the front line and on the edge of legality to prevent youngsters degrade?

The Code for Europe project in Amsterdam offered these three challenges to the Fellows, and were given 9 months to solve them. After the turning point of their project, they will present discoveries, lessons learned, obstacles, apps that were built and future plans.

Feedback from the Appsterdam community will help drive the development of the last phase of the project!

Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.

In the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.
